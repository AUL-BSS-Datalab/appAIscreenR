N2  - Race towards industry 4.0 increases the hyper competition and puts pressure on organizations to integrate the advanced technologies. Business intelligence system (BIS) is one of the top prioritized technologies that attracted the significant attention of policy-makers and industry experts due to its ability to provide more informed and intelligent knowledge for decision-making processes. It is evident by literature that organizations and industries are prone to integrate the BIS at large scale, but more than 70% BIS projects fail to give the expected results. Hence, it is pertinent to explore the significant determinants that influence the BIS adoption and acceptance in organizations. Although previous literature did not have any comprehensive review relevant to the individual, technological, organizational, and environmental determinants. Therefore, the current study tries to narrow this gap by a systematic literature review (SLR) of 84 studies that were published during the period of 2011-2020. A total of 93 determinants are identified based on content analysis by using text mining techniques of Yoshikoder and human coding skills. The identified determinants are ranked according to their frequency of use. A theoretical framework has been developed with potential determinants and theories. The study results will enrich the recent BIS literature and improve the understanding of practitioners' decision-making processes to leverage maximum value from the adoption of BIS. © 2020 by the authors.

PD  - 
N2  - High-entropy/multicomponent alloy (HEA/MCA) has received significant research attention in the last decade. There is a dearth of data-driven works dedicated to assessing and visualizing the HEA/MCA literature from a global perspective. To this end, we present the first bibliometric literature analysis of more than 3500 HEA/MCA articles, published between 2004 and 2021, in the Scopus database. We identify the most prolific authors, their collaborators, institutions, and most prominent research outlet. Co-occurrence networks of keywords are mapped and analyzed. A steep rise in research outputs is observed from 2013, when the number of annual publications doubled the previous years. The top five preferred research outlets include Journal of Alloys and Compounds, Materials Science and Engineering A, Scripta Materialia, Intermetallics, and Acta Materialia. Most of these publications emanate from researchers and institutions within China, USA, and Germany, although international scientific collaboration among them is lacking. Research gaps and future research directions are proposed, based on co-occurrence frequencies of author keywords. Finally, a brief systematic review of emerging applications, covering hydrogen storage, additive manufacturing, catalysis, and superconductivity, is undertaken. This work provides an important comprehensive reference guide for researchers to deepen their knowledge of the field and pursue new research directions. © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Purpose: This paper aims to review the topic of “luxury fashion consumption”, a field of recent interest for academics and practitioners. However, a literature review that can map the existing knowledge and aggregate it into relevant topics and offers a research agenda for future research is still lacking. Methodology: This paper uses a systematic review and a text mining approach to analyse 73 articles on luxury fashion consumption aiming to clarify, rationalise and critically interpret the literature on luxury fashion consumption; identify the core topic, create an integrative framework of core constructs; and offer research gaps and suggest a research agenda for future studies. Findings: From this analysis, eight major research topics are found and analysed (brand desire, authenticity, luxury markets, value perceptions, luxury retail experience, luxury brands communication, responsible consumption and sustainability and status signalling). Based on these topics and following the TCM framework, this review offers directions for future research. Value: This research offers a text-mining review of luxury fashion consumption to help scholars and managers further develop this field, as there is no comprehensive review on the topic exploring the themes, theories, constructs and methods used in prior studies. © 2022, Aihoor Aleem, Sandra Maria Correia Loureiro and Ricardo Godinho Bilro.

N2  - A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) allows us to combine and analyze data from multiple (published and unpublished) studies. Though it provides a complete and comprehensive empirical evidence of an area of interest, the results we usually get from the data synthesis phase of an SLR include huge tables and graphs and thus, for users, it is a tedious and time-consuming job to get the required results. In this work, we propose to semi-automate some steps which can be used to fetch the information from an SLR, beyond the traditional tables, graphs, and plots. The automation is performed using Semantic Web technologies like ontology, Jena API and SPARQL queries. The Semantic Web, also called Web 3.0, provides a common framework and thus allows us to share and re-use the data across the applications and enterprises. It can be used to integrate, extract, and infer the most relevant data required by the users, which are hidden behind the huge information on the Web. We also provide an easy-to-use user interface in order to allow users to perform different searches and find their required SLR results easily and quickly. Finally, we present the results of a preliminary user study performed to analyze the amount of time users need to extract their required information, both via the SLR tables and our proposal. The results revealed that with our system the users get their required information in less time compared to the manual system. © 2018 IEEE.

N2  - The substantial volume, continued growth, and resulting complexity of the scientific literature not only increases the need for systematic, replicable, and rigorous literature reviews, but also highlights the natural limits of human researchers’ information processing capabilities. In search of a solution to this dilemma, computational techniques are beginning to support human researchers in synthesizing large bodies of literature. However, actionable methodological guidance on how to design, conduct, and document such computationally augmented literature reviews is lacking to date. We respond by introducing and defining computational literature reviews (CLRs) as a new review method and put forward a six-step roadmap, covering the CLR process from identifying the review objectives to selecting algorithms and reporting findings. We make the CLR method accessible to novice and expert users alike by identifying critical design decisions and typical challenges for each step and provide practical guidelines for tailoring the CLR method to four conceptual review goals. As such, we present CLRs as a literature review method where the choice, design, and implementation of a CLR are guided by specific review objectives, methodological capabilities, and resource constraints of the human researcher. © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Background: Evidence from new health technologies is growing, along with demands for evidence to inform policy decisions, creating challenges in completing health technology assessments (HTAs)/systematic reviews (SRs) in a timely manner. Software can decrease the time and burden by automating the process, but evidence validating such software is limited. We tested the accuracy of RobotReviewer, a semi-autonomous risk of bias (RoB) assessment tool, and its agreement with human reviewers. Methods: Two reviewers independently conducted RoB assessments on a sample of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and their consensus ratings were compared with those generated by RobotReviewer. Agreement with the human reviewers was assessed using percent agreement and weighted kappa (κ). The accuracy of RobotReviewer was also assessed by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve in comparison to the consensus agreement of the human reviewers. Results: The study included 372 RCTs. Inter-rater reliability ranged from κ = −0.06 (no agreement) for blinding of participants and personnel to κ = 0.62 (good agreement) for random sequence generation (excluding overall RoB). RobotReviewer was found to use a high percentage of “irrelevant supporting quotations” to complement RoB assessments for blinding of participants and personnel (72.6%), blinding of outcome assessment (70.4%), and allocation concealment (54.3%). Conclusion: RobotReviewer can help with risk of bias assessment of RCTs but cannot replace human evaluations. Thus, reviewers should check and validate RoB assessments from RobotReviewer by consulting the original article when not relevant supporting quotations are provided by RobotReviewer. This consultation is in line with the recommendation provided by the developers. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

N2  - PURPOSE The medical literature relevant to germline genetics is growing exponentially. Clinicians need tools that help to monitor and prioritize the literature to understand the clinical implications of pathogenic genetic variants. We developed and evaluated two machine learning models to classify abstracts as relevant to the penetrance—risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers—or prevalence of germline genetic mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted literature searches in PubMed and retrieved paper titles and abstracts to create an annotated data set for training and evaluating the two machine learning classification models. Our first model is a support vector machine (SVM) which learns a linear decision rule on the basis of the bag-of-ngrams representation of each title and abstract. Our second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) which learns a complex nonlinear decision rule on the basis of the raw title and abstract. We evaluated the performance of the two models on the classification of papers as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. RESULTS For penetrance classification, we annotated 3,740 paper titles and abstracts and evaluated the two models using 10-fold cross-validation. The SVM model achieved 88.93% accuracy—percentage of papers that were correctly classified—whereas the CNN model achieved 88.53% accuracy. For prevalence classification, we annotated 3,753 paper titles and abstracts. The SVM model achieved 88.92% accuracy and the CNN model achieved 88.52% accuracy. CONCLUSION Our models achieve high accuracy in classifying abstracts as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. By facilitating literature review, this tool could help clinicians and researchers keep abreast of the burgeoning knowledge of gene–cancer associations and keep the knowledge bases for clinical decision support tools up to date. © 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

N2  - Systematic reviewers are simultaneously unable to produce systematic reviews fast enough to keep up with the availability of new trial evidence while overproducing systematic reviews that are unlikely to change practice because they are redundant or biased. Although the transparency and completeness of trial reporting has improved with changes in policy and new technologies, systematic reviews have not yet benefited from the same level of effort. We found that new methods and tools used to automate aspects of systematic review processes have focused on improving the efficiency of individual systematic reviews rather than the efficiency of the entire ecosystem of systematic review production. We use software engineering principles to review challenges and opportunities for improving the interoperability, integrity, efficiency, and maintainability. We conclude by recommending ways to improve access to structured systematic review results. Major opportunities for improving systematic reviews will come from new tools and changes in policy focused on doing the right systematic reviews rather than just doing more of them faster. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Gender equality is a major problem that places women at a disadvantage thereby stymieing economic growth and societal advancement. In the last two decades, extensive research has been conducted on gender related issues, studying both their antecedents and consequences. However, existing literature reviews fail to provide a comprehensive and clear picture of what has been studied so far, which could guide scholars in their future research. Our paper offers a scoping review of a large portion of the research that has been published over the last 22 years, on gender equality and related issues, with a specific focus on business and economics studies. Combining innovative methods drawn from both network analysis and text mining, we provide a synthesis of 15,465 scientific articles. We identify 27 main research topics, we measure their relevance from a semantic point of view and the relationships among them, highlighting the importance of each topic in the overall gender discourse. We find that prominent research topics mostly relate to women in the workforce-e.g., concerning compensation, role, education, decision-making and career progression. However, some of them are losing momentum, and some other research trends-for example related to female entrepreneurship, leadership and participation in the board of directors-are on the rise. Besides introducing a novel methodology to review broad literature streams, our paper offers a map of the main gender-research trends and presents the most popular and the emerging themes, as well as their intersections, outlining important avenues for future research. © 2021 Belingheri et al.

N2  - Systematic reviews (SR) are vital to health care, but have become complicated and time-consuming, due to the rapid expansion of evidence to be synthesised. Fortunately, many tasks of systematic reviews have the potential to be automated or may be assisted by automation. Recent advances in natural language processing, text mining and machine learning have produced new algorithms that can accurately mimic human endeavour in systematic review activity, faster and more cheaply. Automation tools need to be able to work together, to exchange data and results. Therefore, we initiated the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR), to successfully put all the parts of automation of systematic review production together. The first meeting was held in Vienna in October 2015. We established a set of principles to enable tools to be developed and integrated into toolkits. This paper sets out the principles devised at that meeting, which cover the need for improvement in efficiency of SR tasks, automation across the spectrum of SR tasks, continuous improvement, adherence to high quality standards, flexibility of use and combining components, the need for a collaboration and varied skills, the desire for open source, shared code and evaluation, and a requirement for replicability through rigorous and open evaluation. Automation has a great potential to improve the speed of systematic reviews. Considerable work is already being done on many of the steps involved in a review. The 'Vienna Principles' set out in this paper aim to guide a more coordinated effort which will allow the integration of work by separate teams and build on the experience, code and evaluations done by the many teams working across the globe. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - The application of digital technologies in agriculture can improve traditional practices to adapt to climate change, reduce Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions, and promote a sustainable intensification for food security. Some authors argued that we are experiencing a Digital Agricultural Revolution (DAR) that will boost sustainable farming. This study aims to find evidence of the ongoing DAR process and clarify its roots, what it means, and where it is heading. We investigated the scientific literature with bibliometric analysis tools to produce an objective and reproducible literature review. We retrieved 4995 articles by querying the Web of Science database in the timespan 2012-2019, and we analyzed the obtained dataset to answer three specific research questions: i) what is the spectrum of the DAR-related terminology?; ii) what are the key articles and the most influential journals, institutions, and countries?; iii) what are the main research streams and the emerging topics? By grouping the authors' keywords reported on publications, we identified five main research streams: Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), Site-Specific Management (SSM), Remote Sensing (RS), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). To provide a broad overview of each of these topics, we analyzed relevant review articles, and we present here the main achievements and the ongoing challenges. Finally, we showed the trending topics of the last three years (2017, 2018, 2019). © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Introduction There is wide recognition that, if healthcare systems continue along current trajectories, they will become harder to sustain. Ageing populations, accelerating rates of chronic disease, increasing costs, inefficiencies, wasteful spending and low-value care pose significant challenges to healthcare system durability. Sustainable healthcare systems are important to patients, society, policy-makers, public and private funders, the healthcare workforce and researchers. To capture current thinking about improving healthcare system sustainability, we present a protocol for the systematic review of grey literature to capture the current state-of-knowledge and to compliment a review of peer-reviewed literature. Methods and analysis The proposed search strategy, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines, includes Google Advanced Search, snowballing techniques and targeted hand searching of websites of lead organisations such as WHO, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, governments, public policy institutes, universities and non-government organisations. Documents will be selected after reviewing document summaries. Included documents will undergo full-Text review. The following criteria will be used: grey literature document; English language; published January 2013-March 2018; relevant to the healthcare delivery system; the content has international or national scope in high-income countries. Documents will be assessed for quality, credibility and objectivity using validated checklists. Descriptive data elements will be extracted: identified sustainability threats, definitions of sustainability, attributes of sustainable healthcare systems, solutions for improvement and outcome measures of sustainability. Data will be analysed using novel text-mining methods to identify common concept themes and meanings. This will be triangulated with the more traditional analysis and concept theming by the researchers. Ethics and dissemination No primary data will be collected, therefore ethical approval will not be sought. The results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed literature, as conference presentations and as condensed summaries for policy-makers and health system partners.

N2  - To gain a comprehensive overview of new scientific findings with the enormous, ever-increasing amount of published information, we apply a new combinatorial approach that complements the process of reading scientific articles by supplementing artificial intelligence technologies. We present a combinatorial approach, which we illustrate in the form of a 'double funnel of artificial intelligence.' Our approach suggests to largely increase the amount of data at the beginning of the data collection process and to subsequently clean and enrich the data set in order to gain much more knowledge at the end of the procedure compared to a 'classical' literature review. We use natural language processing and text visualization techniques to uncover findings that are generally unbeknown to the human reader due to the inability to process very large amounts of text. By illustrating the individual steps using practical examples taken from use cases, we demonstrate the merits of our approach. With our methodology, we are able to reproduce findings from 'regular' review papers; however, we discover additional and new findings in different fields, such as data science or medicine. We also point out the limitations of our approach. Finally, we make suggestions as to how the methodology could be further developed. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Background: Robotic (RTKA) and computer-navigated total knee arthroplasty (CNTKA) are increasingly replacing manual techniques in orthopaedic surgery. This systematic review compared clinical outcomes associated with RTKA and CNTKA and investigated the utility of natural language processing (NLP) for the literature synthesis. Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was implemented. Results of included studies were combined and analysed. A transfer learning approach was applied to train deep NLP classifiers (BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet), with cross-validation, to partially automate the systematic review process. Results: 52 studies were included, comprising 5,067 RTKA and 2,108 CNTKA. Complication rates were 0–22% and 0–16% and surgical time was 70–116 and 77–102 min for RTKA and CNTKA, respectively. Technical failures were more commonly associated with RTKA (8%) than CNTKA (2–4%). Patient satisfaction was equivalent (94%). RTKA was associated with a higher likelihood of achieving target alignment, less femoral notching, shorter operative time and shorter length of stay. NLP models demonstrated moderate performance (AUC = 0.65–0.68). Conclusions: RTKA and CNTKA appear to be associated with similarly positive clinical outcomes. Further work is required to determine whether the two techniques differ significantly with regard to specific outcome measures. NLP shows promise for facilitating the systematic review process. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Glioma is the most common primary intraparenchymal tumor of the brain and the 5-year survival rate of high-grade glioma is poor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for detecting, characterizing and monitoring brain tumors but definitive diagnosis still relies on surgical pathology. Machine learning has been applied to the analysis of MRI data in glioma research and has the potential to change clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. This systematic review synthesizes and analyzes the current state of machine learning applications to glioma MRI data and explores the use of machine learning for systematic review automation. Various datapoints were extracted from the 153 studies that met inclusion criteria and analyzed. Natural language processing (NLP) analysis involved keyword extraction, topic modeling and document classification. Machine learning has been applied to tumor grading and diagnosis, tumor segmentation, non-invasive genomic biomarker identification, detection of progression and patient survival prediction. Model performance was generally strong (AUC = 0.87 ± 0.09; sensitivity = 0.87 ± 0.10; specificity = 0.0.86 ± 0.10; precision = 0.88 ± 0.11). Convolutional neural network, support vector machine and random forest algorithms were top performers. Deep learning document classifiers yielded acceptable performance (mean 5-fold cross-validation AUC = 0.71). Machine learning tools and data resources were synthesized and summarized to facilitate future research. Machine learning has been widely applied to the processing of MRI data in glioma research and has demonstrated substantial utility. NLP and transfer learning resources enabled the successful development of a replicable method for automating the systematic review article screening process, which has potential for shortening the time from discovery to clinical application in medicine. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Automation and robotics technology is expected to improve the productivity of the construction industry as well as to solve problems such as labor shortage and safety risks, especially for high-rise buildings. Substantial research efforts have been devoted to the field over the past decades, while the application rate at the construction sites is still limited. Although various reviews have summarized the research topics and future trends in this field, few research efforts have been made on a consideration of both academic research and practical application in the industry. Focusing on high-rise building construction, this study explores the development of both academic research and practical application of automation and robotics based on literature and market review. Scientometric and critical literature reviews were conducted to identify and analyze the development of key research areas based on academic publications from the 1980s to present. In the meantime, the development of basic technologies was summarized. The market review surveyed on existing products and developers of construction automation and robotics. By comparing the results of the literature review and market review, four development patterns of academic research and product application were identified, i.e., simultaneous development led by the same party, development at a similar pace with the two sides taking the lead in different aspects, academic research providing basic technologies for product development, and available technologies in academic research with no products found. Then three gaps in this field, i.e., the gap between academic research and products, the gap between products and application, and the gap between the construction industry and the robotics industry, were discussed with corresponding suggestions to narrow the gaps, followed by an outlook for future directions. This study contributes to the knowledge body by identifying and analyzing the key research areas and the development gaps systematically. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

PD  - 
N2  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have enabled unbiased identification of genetic loci contributing to common complex diseases. Because GWAS loci often harbor many variants and genes, it remains a major challenge to move from GWASs’ statistical associations to the identification of causal variants and genes that underlie these association signals. Researchers have applied many statistical and functional fine-mapping strategies to prioritize genetic variants and genes as potential candidates. There is no gold standard in fine-mapping approaches, but consistent results across different approaches can improve confidence in the fine-mapping findings. Here, we combined text mining with a systematic review and formed a catalog of 85 studies with evidence of fine mapping for at least one autoimmune GWAS locus. Across all fine-mapping studies, we compiled 230 GWAS loci with allelic heterogeneity estimates and predictions of causal variants and trait-relevant genes. These 230 loci included 455 combinations of locus-by-disease association signals with 15 autoimmune diseases. Using these estimates, we assessed the probability of mediating disease risk associations across genes in GWAS loci and identified robust signals of causal disease biology. We predict that this comprehensive catalog of GWAS fine-mapping efforts in autoimmune disease will greatly help distill the plethora of information in the field and inform therapeutic strategies. © 2021 The Author(s)

N2  - Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are widely studied across many scientific disciplines using a variety of techniques in diverse environments. Due to the wide scope of NHP research, substantial overlap in research topics and questions can occur, whose resulting scientific evidence is synthesized by literature reviews. Identifying all relevant research on a particular topic involving NHPs can be difficult and time consuming. By adopting objective search development techniques from systematic reviews, we developed search filters to detect all scientific publications involving NHPs in PubMed, PsycINFO (via EBSCOhost), and Web of Science. We compared the performance of our comprehensive NHP search filters to search strings typical of a novice database user (i.e., NHP simple search strings) and validated their sensitivity by combining these searches with a topic search of cortisol related studies. For all comparisons, our comprehensive NHP search filters retrieved considerably more scientific publications than the NHP simple search strings. Importantly, our comprehensive NHP search filters are easy to use (text can be copied and pasted into the database search engine) and detect the most recent publications that have yet to be indexed by the bibliographic databases queried. Additionally, we developed filterNHP, an R package and web-based application (https://filterNHP.dpz.eu), for researchers interested in literature searches involving a taxonomic sub-group of NHPs. filterNHP alleviates time necessary for adapting our comprehensive NHP search filters for a particular NHP sub-group by automatizing the creation of these search filters. Altogether, our comprehensive NHP search filters and those for taxonomic sub-groups generated by filterNHP will enable swift and easy retrieval of the available scientific literature involving NHPs, and thereby help enhance the quality of new NHP literature reviews that guide future scientific research (new experiments) and public policy (e.g., on welfare and conservation). © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - This paper focuses on how the relations between performance management and measurement (PMM) and strategy are considered by scholars. These relations are crucial in building a comprehensive body of knowledge of a complex and multifaceted phenomenon which attracts scholars pertaining to different management disciplines. The results obtained by adopting quantitative methodologies (descriptive statistics and text-mining analysis) on a sample of articles recently published in the most influential international 'business, and management accounting' journals, contribute to extant literature by providing evidence that several connections exist between key-concepts which are usually considered an exclusive heritage of single management disciplines, such as strategy, organisation, management control, and so forth. For that reason, an integration of competences and methodologies is needed to support further research in the field. We also find evidence suggesting that the organisational perspective should be particularly considered when investigating the relations between strategy, management control systems and PMM. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

PD  - 
N2  - Researchers in the field of Software Fault Prediction (SFP) make use of software metrics to build predictive models, for example, by means of machine learning and statistical techniques. The number of metrics used for SFP has increased dramatically in the last few decades. Therefore, a taxonomy of metrics for SFP could be useful to standardize the lexicon, to simplify the communication among researchers/practitioners, and to organize and classify such metrics. In this research, we built a taxonomy of metrics for SFP with the aim of making it as comprehensive as possible. We exploited and extended two Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) to collect and classify a total of 512 metrics for SFP and then to build our taxonomy. We also provide information on the metrics in this taxonomy in terms of: acronym(s), extended name, description, granularity of the prediction, category, and research papers in which they were used. To allow the taxonomy to be constantly updated over time, we provide external contributors the possibility to ask for changes via pull-requests on GitHub. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - A New Citation Recommendation Strategy Based on Term Functions in Related Studies Section
AU  - Chen, H.
PY  - 2021
PD  - 
N2  - Researchers frequently encounter the following problems when writing scientific articles: (1) Selecting appropriate citations to support the research idea is challenging. (2) The literature review is not conducted extensively, which leads to working on a research problem that others have well addressed. The study focuses on citation recommendation in the related studies section by applying the term function of a citation context, potentially improving the efficiency of writing a literature review. We present nine term functions with three newly created and six identified from existing literature. Using these term functions as labels, we annotate 531 research papers in three topics to evaluate our proposed recommendation strategy. BM25 and Word2vec with VSM are implemented as the baseline models for the recommendation. Then the term function information is applied to enhance the performance. The experiments show that the term function-based methods outperform the baseline methods regarding the recall, precision, and F1-score measurement, demonstrating that term functions are useful in identifying valuable citations. The dataset is insufficient due to the complexity of annotating citation functions for paragraphs in the related studies section. More recent deep learning models should be performed to future validate the proposed approach. The citation recommendation strategy can be helpful for valuable citation discovery, semantic scientific retrieval, and automatic literature review generation. The proposed citation function-based citation recommendation can generate intuitive explanations of the results for users, improving the transparency, persuasiveness, and effectiveness of recommender systems. © 2021 2021 Haihua Chen, published by Sciendo.

N2  - Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery (FDRM) has attracted continuous attention because of its great importance to industrial engineering, promoting the healthy and prosperous development of the field. A large number of literature reviews on FDRM have been reported, including signal processing methods in FDRM; artificial intelligence techniques in FDRM; fault diagnosis of bearings, gearboxes and induction motors; and others with broader areas of focus. Using bibliometric techniques, this paper provides objective insight and presents a comprehensive review of FDRM. The review begins with rigorous bibliometric analyses of 2532 published studies. These analyses enable mapping the scope and structure of the discipline, discovering the established collaboration patterns among countries and institutions, and identifying authoritative papers and authors.

N2  - Background: Visual analytics (VA) promotes the understanding of data with visual, interactive techniques, using analytic and visual engines. The analytic engine includes automated techniques, whereas common visual outputs include flow maps and spatiotemporal hot spots. Objective: This scoping review aims to address a gap in the literature, with the specific objective to synthesize literature on the use of VA tools, techniques, and frameworks in interrelated health care areas of population health and health services research (HSR). Methods: Using the 2018 PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, the review focuses on peer-reviewed journal articles and full conference papers from 2005 to March 2019. Two researchers were involved at each step, and another researcher arbitrated disagreements. A comprehensive abstraction platform captured data from diverse bodies of the literature, primarily from the computer and health sciences. Results: After screening 11,310 articles, findings from 55 articles were synthesized under the major headings of visual and analytic engines, visual presentation characteristics, tools used and their capabilities, application to health care areas, data types and sources, VA frameworks, frameworks used for VA applications, availability and innovation, and co-design initiatives. We found extensive application of VA methods used in areas of epidemiology, surveillance and modeling, health services access, use, and cost analyses. All articles included a distinct analytic and visualization engine, with varying levels of detail provided. Most tools were prototypes, with 5 in use at the time of publication. Seven articles presented methodological frameworks. Toward consistent reporting, we present a checklist, with an expanded definition for VA applications in health care, to assist researchers in sharing research for greater replicability. We summarized the results in a Tableau dashboard. Conclusions: With the increasing availability and generation of big health care data, VA is a fast-growing method applied to complex health care data. What makes VA innovative is its capability to process multiple, varied data sources to demonstrate trends and patterns for exploratory analysis, leading to knowledge generation and decision support. This is the first review to bridge a critical gap in the literature on VA methods applied to the areas of population health and HSR, which further indicates possible avenues for the adoption of these methods in the future. This review is especially important in the wake of COVID-19 surveillance and response initiatives, where many VA products have taken center stage. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide readers with a comprehensive overview of scholarly work on the depression of caregivers using bibliometrics and text mining. Methods: A total of 426 articles published between 2000 and 2018 were retrieved from the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science, and then, computer-aided bibliometric analysis as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling were conducted on the collection of the data. Results: Descriptive statistics on the increasing number of publications, network analysis of scientific collaboration between countries, word co-occurrence analysis, conceptual structure, and six latent topics (k = 6) identified are discussed. Conclusions: Preventing or managing depression among caregivers is a growing field with the highest priority for the aging population. In the future, collaborating between countries and reflecting cultural backgrounds in caregiver depression research are needed. This study is expected to contribute to the field of psychological distress of caregivers in looking a big picture of the current position through data-driven analysis and moving forward towards a better direction. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Aim: New software packages help to improve the efficiency of conducting a systematic review through automation of key steps in the systematic review. The aim of this study was to gather qualitative data on the usability and acceptability of four systematic review automation software packages (Covidence, SRA-Helper for EndNote, Rayyan and RobotAnalyst) for the citation screening step of a systematic review. Methods: We recruited three volunteer systematic reviewers and asked them to use allocated software packages during citation screening. They then completed a 12-item online questionnaire which was tailored to capture data for the software packages used. Findings: All four software packages were reported to be easy or very easy to learn and use. SRA-Helper for EndNote was most favoured by participants for screening citations and Covidence for resolving conflicts. Overall, participants reported that SRA-Helper for EndNote would be their software package of choice, primarily due to its efficiency. Conclusion: This study identified a number of considerations which systematic reviewers can use as a basis of their decision which software to use when performing the citation screening and dispute resolution steps of a systematic review. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - In turning operations, the wear of cutting tools is inevitable. As workpieces produced with worn tools may fail to meet specifications, the machining industries focus on replacement policies that mitigate the risk of losses due to scrap. Several strategies, from empiric laws to more advanced statistical models, have been proposed in the literature. More recently, many monitoring systems based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been developed. Due to the scope of different artificial intelligence approaches, having a holistic view of the state of the art on this subject is complex, in part due to a lack of recent comprehensive reviews. This literature review therefore presents 20 years of literature on this subject obtained following a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology. This SLR aims to answer the following research question: “How is the AI used in the framework of monitoring/predicting the condition of tools in stable turning condition?” To answer this research question, the “Scopus” database was consulted in order to gather relevant publications published between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2021. The systematic approach yielded 8426 articles among which 102 correspond to the inclusion and exclusion criteria which limit the application of AI to stable turning operation and online prediction. A bibliometric analysis performed on these articles highlighted the growing interest of this subject in the recent years. A more in-depth analysis of the articles is also presented, mainly focusing on six AI techniques that are highly represented in the literature: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For each technique, the trends in the inputs, pre-processing techniques, and outputs of the AI are presented. The trends highlight the early and continuous importance of ANN, and the emerging interest of CNN for tool condition monitoring. The lack of common benchmark database for evaluating models performance does not allow clear comparisons of technique performance. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - In recent years, the research on human behaviour in relation to waste management has increased at an exponential rate. At the same time, the expanding academic literature on this topic makes it more difficult to understand the main areas of interest, the leading institutions and authors, the possible interconnections among different disciplines, and the gaps. This paper maps knowledge domain on recycling behaviour through bibliometric analysis and text mining in order to identify current trends, research networks and hot topics. 2061 articles between 1975 and 2020 from three different databases are examined with an interdisciplinary approach. The findings reveal that 60% of papers have been published between 2015 and 2020, and this topic is of global interest. Leading countries are mainly located in Europe, North America and Commonwealth; however, China and Malaysia are also assuming a driving role. Bibliometrics and text mining provide the intellectual configuration of the knowledge on recycling behaviour; co-word analysis individuates conceptual sub-domains in food waste, determinants of recycling behaviour, waste management system, waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), higher-level education, plastic bags, and local government. Overall, waste management and related human behaviour represent a universal challenge requiring a structured and interdisciplinary approach at all levels (individual, institutions, industry, academia). Lastly, this paper offers some suggestions for future research such as smart city design, sensor network system, consumer responsibilisation, the adoption of a more comprehensive view of the areas of investigation through the holistic analysis of all stakeholders. © 2021 The Authors

N2  - The objective of technology-assisted review ("TAR") is to find as much relevant information as possible with reasonable effort. Quality is a measure of the extent to which a TAR method achieves this objective, while reliability is a measure of how consistently it achieves an acceptable result. We are concerned with how to define, measure, and achieve high quality and high reliability in TAR. When quality is defined using the traditional goal-post method of specifying a minimum acceptable recall threshold, the quality and reliability of a TAR method are both, by definition, equal to the probability of achieving the threshold. Assuming this definition of quality and reliability, we show how to augment any TAR method to achieve guaranteed reliability, for a quantifiable level of additional review effort. We demonstrate this result by augmenting the TAR method supplied as the baseline model implementation for the TREC 2015 Total Recall Track, measuring reliability and effort for 555 topics from eight test collections. While our empirical results corroborate our claim of guaranteed reliability, we observe that the augmentation strategy may entail disproportionate effort, especially when the number of relevant documents is low. To address this limitation, we propose stopping criteria for the model implementation that may be applied with no additional review effort, while achieving empirical reliability that compares favorably to the provably reliable method. We further argue that optimizing reliability according to the traditional goal-post method is inconsistent with certain subjective aspects of quality, and that optimizing a Taguchi quality loss function may be more apt. © 2016 ACM.

N2  - As current action remains insufficient to meet the goals of the Paris agreement let alone to stabilize the climate, there is increasing hope that solutions related to demand, services and social aspects of climate change mitigation can close the gap. However, given these topics are not investigated by a single epistemic community, the literature base underpinning the associated research continues to be undefined. Here, we aim to delineate a plausible body of literature capturing a comprehensive spectrum of demand, services and social aspects of climate change mitigation. As method we use a novel double-stacked expert-machine learning research architecture and expert evaluation to develop a typology and map key messages relevant for climate change mitigation within this body of literature. First, relying on the official key words provided to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by governments (across 17 queries), and on specific investigations of domain experts (27 queries), we identify 121 165 non-unique and 99 065 unique academic publications covering issues relevant for demand-side mitigation. Second, we identify a literature typology with four key clusters: policy, housing, mobility, and food/consumption. Third, we systematically extract key content-based insights finding that the housing literature emphasizes social and collective action, whereas the food/consumption literatures highlight behavioral change, but insights also demonstrate the dynamic relationship between behavioral change and social norms. All clusters point to the possibility of improved public health as a result of demand-side solutions. The centrality of the policy cluster suggests that political actions are what bring the different specific approaches together. Fourth, by mapping the underlying epistemic communities we find that researchers are already highly interconnected, glued together by common interests in sustainability and energy demand. We conclude by outlining avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration, synthetic analysis, community building, and by suggesting next steps for evaluating this body of literature. © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - The SPIRIT 2013 statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human–AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret, and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial. © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: There is a need for easily accessible tuberculosis unit cost data, as well as an understanding of the variability of methods used and reporting standards of that data. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to descriptively review papers reporting tuberculosis unit costs from a healthcare provider perspective looking at methodological variation; to assess quality using a study quality rating system and machine learning to investigate the indicators of reporting quality; and to identify the data gaps to inform standardised tuberculosis unit cost collection and consistent principles for reporting going forward. Methods: We searched grey and published literature in five sources and eight databases, respectively, using search terms linked to cost, tuberculosis and tuberculosis health services including tuberculosis treatment and prevention. For inclusion, the papers needed to contain empirical unit cost estimates for tuberculosis interventions from low- and middle-income countries, with reference years between 1990 and 2018. A total of 21,691 papers were found and screened in a phased manner. Data were extracted from the eligible papers into a detailed Microsoft Excel tool, extensively cleaned and analysed with R software (R Project, Vienna, Austria) using the user interface of RStudio. A study quality rating was applied to the reviewed papers based on the inclusion or omission of a selection of variables and their relative importance. Following this, machine learning using a recursive partitioning method was utilised to construct a classification tree to assess the reporting quality. Results: This systematic review included 103 provider perspective papers with 627 unit costs (costs not presented here) for tuberculosis interventions among a total of 140 variables. The interventions covered were active, passive and intensified case finding; tuberculosis treatment; above-service costs; and tuberculosis prevention. Passive case finding is the detection of tuberculosis cases where individuals self-identify at health facilities; active case finding is detection of cases of those not in health facilities, such as through outreach; and intensified case finding is detection of cases in high-risk populations. There was heterogeneity in some of the reported methods used such cost allocation, amortisation and the use of top-down, bottom-up or mixed approaches to the costing. Uncertainty checking through sensitivity analysis was only reported on by half of the papers (54%), while purposive and convenience sampling was reported by 72% of papers. Machine learning indicated that reporting on ‘Intervention’ (in particular), ‘Urbanicity’ and ‘Site Sampling’, were the most likely indicators of quality of reporting. The largest data gap identified was for tuberculosis vaccination cost data, the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine in particular. There is a gap in available unit costs for 12 of 30 high tuberculosis burden countries, as well as for the interventions of above-service costs, tuberculosis prevention, and active and intensified case finding. Conclusion: Variability in the methods and reporting used makes comparison difficult and makes it hard for decision makers to know which unit costs they can trust. The study quality rating system used in this review as well as the classification tree enable focus on specific reporting aspects that should improve variability and increase confidence in unit costs. Researchers should endeavour to be explicit and transparent in how they cost interventions following the principles as laid out in the Global Health Cost Consortium’s Reference Case for Estimating the Costs of Global Health Services and Interventions, which in turn will lead to repeatability, comparability and enhanced learning from others. © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - This lecture-style tutorial, which mixes in an interactive literature browsing component, is intended for the many researchers and practitioners working with text data and on applications of natural language processing (NLP) in data science and knowledge discovery. The focus of the tutorial is on the issues of transparency and interpretability as they relate to building models for text and their applications to knowledge discovery. As black-box models have gained popularity for a broad range of tasks in recent years, both the research and industry communities have begun developing new techniques to render them more transparent and interpretable. Reporting from an interdisciplinary team of social science, human-computer interaction (HCI), and NLP/knowledge management researchers, our tutorial has two components: an introduction to explainable AI (XAI) in the NLP domain and a review of the state-of-the-art research; and findings from a qualitative interview study of individuals working on real-world NLP projects as they are applied to various knowledge extraction and discovery at a large, multinational technology and consulting corporation. The first component will introduce core concepts related to explainability in NLP. Then, we will discuss explainability for NLP tasks and report on a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art literature in AI, NLP and HCI conferences. The second component reports on our qualitative interview study, which identifies practical challenges and concerns that arise in real-world development projects that require the modeling and understanding of text data. © 2021 Owner/Author.

N2  - The identification of human behavior can provide useful information across multiple job spectra. Recent advances in applying data-based approaches to social sciences have increased the feasibility of modeling human behavior. In particular, studying human behavior by analyzing unstructured textual data has recently received considerable attention because of the abundance of textual data. The main objective of the present study was to discuss the primary methods for identifying and predicting human behavior through the mining of unstructured textual data. Of the 823 articles analyzed, 87 met the predefined inclusion criteria and were included in the literature review. Our results show that the included articles could be symmetrically classified into two groups. The first group of articles attempted to identify the leading indicators of human behavior in unstructured textual data. In this group, the data-based approaches had three main components: (1) collecting self-reported survey data, (2) collecting data from social media and extracting data features, and (3) applying correlation analysis to evaluate the relationship between two sets of data. In contrast, the second group focused on the accuracy of data-based approaches for predicting human behavior. In this group, the data-based approaches could be categorized into (1) approaches based on labeled unstructured textual data and (2) approaches based on unlabeled unstructured textual data. The review provides a comprehensive insight into unstructured textual data mining to identify and predict human behavior and personality traits. © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - The concept of Big Data in academic and professional literature has developed in a euphoric, chaotic, and unstructured manner. Decision-making is increasingly relying on Big Data, resorting to novel analytic methodologies that are applied in many different industries. This study aims to provide clarity over the Big Data phenomenon by means of a comprehensive and systematic literature review, able to produce a clear description of what Big Data is today, a structured classification of the various streams of current research, and a list of promising emerging trends. This study analyses a corpus of 4,327 articles through a novel combination of unsupervised algorithms that produces a hierarchical topic structure which empirically validates and enhances the "Information," "Technology," "Methods," and "Impact" conceptual model of Big Data, identifying 17 fundamental topics and providing researchers and practitioners with a meaningful overview of the body of knowledge and a proposed research agenda. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.

N2  - Gender intersects with healthcare systems; this is equally true for arboviral vector control efforts. However, there is as yet no comprehensive analysis as to how vector control is gendered. Hence, our objective is to provide the first thematic scoping and spatial distribution of the literature on gender, community health workers, and vector control. The authors use a systematic review approach to collect the academic literature on gender, community health workers, and vector control in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed (7,367 articles). After applying the exclusion criteria, 2,812 articles were analyzed using machine learning techniques: text mining and quantitative text analysis. The authors use topic modeling to assess the thematic scope of the literature and analyze the spatial distribution of themes. Our results show that the literature’s spatial scope is strongly represented by the global south as research was conducted mainly in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, places with greater incidence of vector-borne disease and with health systems, which incorporate community healthcare workers. However, there are significant spatial heterogeneities in where and how research is conducted. The topic analysis reveals that the literature predominantly considers issues of sex (e.g., pregnancy) and gender as it relates motherhood. Gendered considerations occur upon implementation of vector control policies, rather than being mainstreamed into their development and delivery. There is a need to deepen the analysis to allow for gendered aspects to be understood beyond binary sex differences and/or reproductive health. © 2022 American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

N2  - PURPOSE Quantifying the risk of cancer associated with pathogenic mutations in germline cancer susceptibility genes—that is, penetrance—enables the personalization of preventive management strategies. Conducting a meta-analysis is the best way to obtain robust risk estimates. We have previously developed a natural language processing (NLP) –based abstract classifier which classifies abstracts as relevant to penetrance, prevalence of mutations, both, or neither. In this work, we evaluate the performance of this NLP-based procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS We compared the semiautomated NLP-based procedure, which involves automated abstract classification and text mining, followed by human review of identified studies, with the traditional procedure that requires human review of all studies. Ten high-quality gene–cancer penetrance meta-analyses spanning 16 gene–cancer associations were used as the gold standard by which to evaluate the performance of our procedure. For each meta-analysis, we evaluated the number of abstracts that required human review (workload) and the ability to identify the studies that were included by the authors in their quantitative analysis (coverage). RESULTS Compared with the traditional procedure, the semiautomated NLP-based procedure led to a lower workload across all 10 meta-analyses, with an overall 84% reduction (2,774 abstracts v 16,941 abstracts) in the amount of human review required. Overall coverage was 93%—we are able to identify 132 of 142 studies—before reviewing references of identified studies. Reasons for the 10 missed studies included blank and poorly written abstracts. After reviewing references, nine of the previously missed studies were identified and coverage improved to 99% (141 of 142 studies). CONCLUSION We demonstrated that an NLP-based procedure can significantly reduce the review workload without compromising the ability to identify relevant studies. NLP algorithms have promising potential for reducing human efforts in the literature review process. © 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

N2  - Systematic reviews are scientific investigations that use strategies to include a comprehensive search of all potentially relevant articles and the use of explicit, reproducible criteria in the selection of articles for review. As time and resources are limited for compiling a systematic review, limits to the search are needed. In this paper, we describe the stopping strategy that we have been designed and refined over three years of participation to the CLEF eHealth Technology Assisted Review Task. In particular, we present a comparison of a Continuous Active Learning approach that uses either a fixed amount or a variable amount of resources according to the size of the pool. The results show that our approach performs on average much better than any other participant in the CLEF 2019 eHealth TAR task. Nevertheless, a failure analysis allows to understand the weak points of this approach and possible future directions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - Over the last decade, quantitative text mining approaches to content analysis have gained increasing traction within information systems research, and related fields, such as business administration. Recently, topic models, which are supposed to provide their user with an overview of themes being discussed in documents, have gained popularity. However, while convenient tools for the creation of this model class exist, the evaluation of topic models poses significant challenges to their users. In this research, we investigate how questions of model validity and trustworthiness of presented analyses are addressed across disciplines. We accomplish this by providing a structured review of methodological approaches across the Financial Times 50 journal ranking. We identify 59 methodological research papers, 24 implementations of topic models, as well as 33 research papers using topic models in Information Systems (IS) research, and 29 papers using such models in other managerial disciplines. Results indicate a need for model implementations usable by a wider audience, as well as the need for more implementations of model validation techniques, and the need for a discussion about the theoretical foundations of topic modelling based research. © 2017 Proceedings of the 25th European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2017.

N2  - The enterprises to be competitive are constantly looking for continuous increase of productivity, quality and level of services. With the development of Industry 4.0 concept, manufacturers are more confident about new advantages of automation and systems integration. Lean management is well developed and empirically proven effective managerial approach. Combining Lean and Industry 4.0 practices seems to be necessary evolutionary step for further raise the level of operational excellence (exploitation of finance, workload, materials, machines/devices). There is an increasing number of Industry 4.0 solutions used to reduce waste (as known from Lean Management). Therefore, the main objective of this article aims at presenting the results of a literature review on the concept of ‘Lean Industry 4.0ʹ. Dynamic methodology called “Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA)” was used. It combines the Systematic Literature Review approach with the quantitative analysis of bibliographic networks to detect emerging topics and the dynamic evolution of the topics. The paper is a comprehensive systematization and rationalization of knowledge about the integration of LM and I4.0 concepts, identifies the most important research trends and defines directions for future research. The article contains a framework that presents the current state of knowledge in the area of Lean Industry 4.0. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Systematic reviews are difficult to keep up to date, but failure to do so leads to a decay in review currency, accuracy, and utility. We are developing a novel approach to systematic review updating termed “Living systematic review” (LSR): systematic reviews that are continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. LSRs may be particularly important in fields where research evidence is emerging rapidly, current evidence is uncertain, and new research may change policy or practice decisions. We hypothesize that a continual approach to updating will achieve greater currency and validity, and increase the benefits to end users, with feasible resource requirements over time. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The availability of massive sets of unstructured data has opened up new opportunities for businesses to gain meaningful insights into what is currently happening in their organization and market place. Unfortunately, unstructured data is often challenging to work with, as it requires specialized toolsets, techniques, knowledge and skills to engage with the data. This study used a systematic review (SLR) process to explore the current and conversant state of affairs in the field of text mining (TM) techniques that exist for the processing of natural language in unstructured text datasets across a broad expanse of applications and domains. A comprehensive literature search yielded 1022 eligible articles from five prominent bibliographic databases, narrowed down to 89 articles for review. Information related to TM techniques, the TM process, applications, challenges and recommendations for the improvement of TM results were extracted and synthesized. Eighteen TM techniques were identified and used to complete a variety of tasks such as data pre-processing, information retrieval, information extraction, text classification, clustering, topic modeling, text summarization and sentiment analysis or opinion mining. No single TM technique may be suitable for all text representation and extraction requirements. Therefore, context and applicability are key factors for TM technique selection. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

PD  - 
N2  - Background: Systematic reviews may provide less biased evidence than narrative reviews because they observe a strict methodology, similarly to primary studies. Hence, for clinical research questions, systematic reviews should be the study design of choice. It would be important to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of narrative and systematic reviews published in prominent medical journals. Researchers and clinicians give great value to articles published in such scientific journals. This study sought to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of narrative and systematic reviews in the five highest-ranked general medical journals and investigate the associations among type of review, number of citations, and impact factor (IF). Methods: We surveyed the five highest-ranked medical journals (The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association, The BMJ, and Annals of Internal Medicine) for narrative and systematic reviews published between June 2015 and June 2016. We independently selected and extracted the data from the reviews by strictly following the pre-determined eligibility criteria (Systematic and narrative reviews that focused on the management of diseases). We conducted regression analyses to investigate the associations among review type, number of citations, and IF. We also descriptively reported narrative reviews containing some methodology that might be reproducible. Results: Two hundred seventy-five reviews were included: 75 (27%) systematic; 126 (46%) narrative with some methodology reported, and 74 (27%) narrative reviews. In comparison to systematic reviews, narrative reviews were more frequently published in journals with higher IF (risk ratio [RR] = 1.114 (95% CI 1.080 to 1.149). Systematic reviews received more citations than narrative reviews (group formed by narrative and narrative with some methodology reported (RR = 0.985 95% CI 0.978 to 0.991). Conclusions: Non-systematic evidence is the most prevalent type of evidence in reviews published in the five highest-ranked general medical journals. Narrative reviews were more frequently published in journals with higher IF. We recommend that journals limit their space for narrative information, and to address clinical research questions, these journals consider publishing systematic evidence exclusively. © 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - This review paper analyzes technology trends observed in New Space missions, using a patent analytics approach. The analysis is complemented with a literature review of the subjects identified. The main objective of this review is to draw a comprehensive picture of technology trends in New Space and to discuss potential scenarios for further development of this novel type of missions. Building on the existing scientific literature, we survey alternative definitions and then propose our own definition of New Space missions as synthesis of the ongoing debate in the field. We identified more than two hundred organizations active in the development of both upstream and downstream products and services for New Space missions. Using a commercially available patent analytics tool, we collected 933 patents protecting technologies disclosed by those organizations. We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modeling algorithm, to analyze patents' data and to identify the underlying structures in New Space's technology trends. Ten major topics have been identified respectively named “Remote sensing & image acquisition”, “Flying/launch systems”, “Telecommunication systems”, “Constellation management”, “Digital Processing Architectures”, “Image analysis”, “Manufacturing process & materials”, “Feature recognition and extraction”, “Antenna systems”, and “Space platforms”. A deeper analysis of patents' claims revealed a core cluster defined as “data cluster” including data analysis topics (Remote sensing & image acquisition, Image analysis, and Feature recognition and extraction), data transmission topics (Telecommunication systems and Antenna systems from both hardware and software perspective) and related enabling technologies such as constellation management. Based on this analysis, the evolution of data cluster related technologies is surveyed in order to review the current technology state of the art as well as identifying potential areas that will benefit the most from further technology developments to improve New Space missions’ performance. Lastly, we identify technology trends for future New Space development based on the insights obtained by the synthesis of our literature and patent survey. We discuss the key directions for future development emerging from our review, such as the use of commercial off the shelf components, the increasing use of miniaturized technology, and software defined technology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Purpose: In spite of growing research interest in cyber security, inter-firm based cyber risk studies are rare. Therefore, this study aims to investigate cyber risk management in supply chain contexts. Design/methodology/approach: Adapting a systematic literature review process, papers from interdisciplinary areas published between 1990 and 2017 were selected. Different typologies, developed for conducting descriptive and thematic analysis, were established using data mining techniques to conduct a comprehensive, replicable and transparent review. Findings: The review identifies multiple future research directions for cyber security/resilience in supply chains. A conceptual model is developed, which indicates a strong link between information technology, organisational and supply chain security systems. The human/behavioural elements within cyber security risk are found to be critical; however, behavioural risks have attracted less attention because of a perceived bias towards technical (data, application and network) risks. There is a need for raising risk awareness, standardised policies, collaborative strategies and empirical models for creating supply chain cyber-resilience. Research limitations/implications: Different types of cyber risks and their points of penetration, propagation levels, consequences and mitigation measures are identified. The conceptual model developed in this study drives an agenda for future research on supply chain cyber security/resilience. Practical implications: A multi-perspective, systematic study provides a holistic guide for practitioners in understanding cyber-physical systems. The cyber risk challenges and the mitigation strategies identified support supply chain managers in making informed decisions. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review on managing cyber risks in supply chains. The review defines supply chain cyber risk and develops a conceptual model for supply chain cyber security systems and an agenda for future studies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Maritime transport faces new safety-related challenges resulting from constantly increasing traffic density, along with increasing dimensions of ships. Consequently, the number of new concepts related to Decision Support Systems (DSSs) supporting safe shipborne operations in the presence of reduced ship manning is rapidly growing, both in academia and industry. However, there is a lack of a systematic description of the state-of-the-art in this field. Moreover, there is no comprehensive overview of the level of technology readiness of proposed concepts. Therefore, this paper presents an analysis aiming at (1) increasing the understanding of the structure and contents of the academic field concerned with this topic; (2) determining and mapping scientific networks in this domain; (3) analyzing and visualizing Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of analyzed systems. Bibliometric methods are utilized to depict the domain of onboard DSSs for operations focused on safety ensurance and accident prevention. The scientific literature is reviewed in a systematic way using a comparative analysis of existing tools. The results indicate that there are relatively many developments in selected DSS categories, such as collision avoidance and ship routing. However, even in these categories some issues and gaps still remain, so further improvements are needed. The analysis indicates a relatively low level of technology readiness of tools and concepts presented in academic literature. This signifies a need to move beyond the conceptual stages toward demonstration and validation in realistic, operating environments. © 2020 The Author(s)

N2  - Tools for automatic subject assignment help deal with scale and sustainability in creating and enriching metadata, establishing more connections across and between resources and enhancing consistency. Although some software vendors and experimental researchers claim the tools can replace manual subject indexing, hard scientific evidence of their performance in operating information environments is scarce. A major reason for this is that research is usually conducted in laboratory conditions, excluding the complexities of real-life systems and situations. The article reviews and discusses issues with existing evaluation approaches such as problems of aboutness and relevance assessments, implying the need to use more than a single “gold standard” method when evaluating indexing and retrieval, and proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework. The framework is informed by a systematic review of the literature on evaluation approaches: evaluating indexing quality directly through assessment by an evaluator or through comparison with a gold standard, evaluating the quality of computer-assisted indexing directly in the context of an indexing workflow, and evaluating indexing quality indirectly through analyzing retrieval performance. © 2015 ASIS&T

N2  - The process of developing systematic reviews is a well established method of collecting evidence from publications, where it follows a predefined and explicit protocol design to promote rigour, transparency and repeatability. The process is manual and involves lot of time and needs expertise. The aim of this work is to build an effective framework using machine learning techniques to partially automate the process of systematic literature review by extracting required data elements of anxiety outcome measures. A framework is thus proposed that initially builds a training corpus by extracting different data elements related to anxiety outcome measures from relevant publications. The publications are retrieved from Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AHMED and Pyscinfo following a given set of rules defined by a research group in the United Kingdom reviewing comfort interventions in health care. Subsequently, the method trains a machine learning classifier using this training corpus to extract the desired data elements from new publications. The experiments are conducted on 48 publications containing anxiety outcome measures with an aim to automatically extract the sentences stating the mean and standard deviation of the measures of outcomes of different types of interventions to lessen anxiety. The experimental results show that the recall and precision of the proposed method using random forest classifier are respectively 100% and 83%, which indicates that the method is able to extract all required data elements. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - Background: Effective measurement of Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment (GEWE) is challenging in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), and even more so in humanitarian settings. Conflict, natural disasters, and epidemics may increase gender inequities, but also present an opportunity to address them. This scoping review describes and identifies gaps in the measurement tools, methods, and indicators used to measure GEWE in humanitarian settings, and presents a dashboard that can be used by researchers, organizations and governments to identify GEWE measurement tools. Methods: Scientific articles published between January 2004 and November 2019 were identified using Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and PAIS index. Relevant non peer-reviewed literature was downloaded from the websites of humanitarian organizations. Publications on women and/or girls impacted by a humanitarian crisis in a LMIC, within 5 years of data collection, were included. Publications were double-screened in the title/abstract and full-text stages. We used a machine learning software during the title/abstract screening to increase the efficiency of the process. Measurement tools, sampling and data collection methods, gap areas (geographical, topical and contextual), and indicators were catalogued for easy access in an interactive Tableau dashboard. Results: Our search yielded 27,197 publications and 2396 non peer-reviewed literature reports. One hundred and seventy publications were included in the final review. Extracted indicators were categorized into seven domains: economic, health, human development, leadership, psychological, security and justice, and sociocultural. The vast majority of studies were observational, and over 70% utilized a cross-sectional study design. Thirty-eight toolkits and questionnaires were identified in this review, of which 19 (50%) were designed specifically for humanitarian settings. Sociocultural was the largest domain in number of studies and indicators in this review, with gender-based violence indicators reported in 66% of studies. Indicators of economic, human development and leadership were uncommon in the peer-reviewed literature. Discussion: While there has been some effort to measure GEWE in conflict-affected and other humanitarian settings, measurement has largely focused on violence and security issues. A more comprehensive framework for measuring GEWE in these settings is needed; objective measurement of women’s empowerment and gender equality should be prioritized by organizations providing humanitarian aid. © 2021, The Author(s).

PD  - 
N2  - Digitally-aided reviews of large bodies of text-based information, such as academic literature, are growing in capability but are not yet common in environmental fields. Environmental sciences and studies can benefit from application of digital tools to create comprehensive, replicable, interdisciplinary reviews that provide rapid, up-to-date, and policy-relevant reports of existing work. This work reviews the potential for applications of computational text mining and analysis tools originating in the humanities to environmental science and policy questions. Two process-oriented case studies of digitally-aided environmental literature reviews and meta-analyses illustrate potential benefits and limitations. A medium-sized, medium-resolution review (∼8000 journal abstracts and titles) focuses on topic modeling as a rapid way to identify thematic changes over time. A small, high-resolution review (∼300 full text journal articles) combines collocation and network analysis with manual coding to synthesize and question empirical field work. We note that even small digitally-aided analyses are close to the upper limit of what can be done manually. Established computational methods developed in humanities disciplines and refined by humanities and social science scholars to interrogate large bodies of textual data are applicable and useful in environmental sciences but have not yet been widely applied. Two case studies provide evidence that digital tools can enhance insight. Two major conclusions emerge. First, digital tools enable scholars to engage large literatures rapidly and, in some cases, more comprehensively than is possible manually. Digital tools can confirm manually identified patterns or identify additional patterns visible only at a large scale. Second, digital tools allow for more replicable and transparent conclusions to be drawn from literature reviews and meta-analyses. The methodological subfields of digital humanities and computational social sciences will likely continue to create innovative tools for analyzing large bodies of text, providing opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration with the environmental fields. ï¿½ 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Over the past decades, enormous progress has been achieved with regard to research on environmentally friendly polymers. One of the most prominent families of such biopolymers are bacterially synthesized polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) that have been known since the 1920s. However, only as recent as the 1990s have extensive studies sprung out exponentially in this matter. Since then, different areas of exploration of these intriguing materials have been uncovered. However, no systematic review of undertaken efforts has been conducted so far. Therefore, we have performed an unbiased search of up-to-date literature to reveal trending topics in the research of PHAs over the past three decades by data mining of 2,227 publications. This allowed us to identify eight past and current trends in this area. Our study provides a comprehensive review of these trends and speculates where PHA research is heading. © Copyright © 2020 Guzik, Witko, Steinbüchel, Wojnarowska, Sołtysik and Wawak.

N2  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the blueprint for achieving a better and more sustainable future for all by defining priorities and aspirations for 2030. In this paper, the attempt was to expand SDGs' definition by performing a comprehensive literature review. Furthermore, the descriptions of SDGs were utilized to compile a Machine Learning (ML) model so to automate the detection of SDG relevancy in other types of artefacts. The model was employed for identifying the SDG relevancy of patents as well-known proxies for innovation. The ML model was then used to classify a sample of patent families registered in the European Patent Office (EPO). The analysis revealed the extend to which SDGs were addressed in patents and the interrelations between SDG definitions. The findings guide how to align patenting strategies as well as measurement and management of their contribution to the realization of the SDGs when it comes to Intellectual Property (IP) strategies. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

N2  - Systematic reviews of the scientific literature can be an important source of information supporting the daily work of the regulators in their decision making, particularly in areas of innovative technologies where the regulatory experience is still limited. Significant research activities in the field of nanotechnology resulted in a huge number of publications in the last decades. However, even if the published data can provide relevant information, scientific articles are often of diverse quality, and it is nearly impossible to manually process and evaluate such amount of data in a systematic manner. In this feasibility study, we investigated to what extent open-access automation tools can support a systematic review of toxic effects of nanomaterials for health applications reported in the scientific literature. In this study, we used a battery of available tools to perform the initial steps of a systematic review such as targeted searches, data curation and abstract screening. This work was complemented with an in-house developed tool that allowed us to extract specific sections of the articles such as the materials and methods part or the results section where we could perform subsequent text analysis. We ranked the articles according to quality criteria based on the reported nanomaterial characterisation and extracted most frequently described toxic effects induced by different types of nanomaterials. Even if further demonstration of the reliability and applicability of automation tools is necessary, this study demonstrated the potential to leverage information from the scientific literature by using automation systems in a tiered strategy. © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a structured way of conducting a review that can assist the researcher in analyzing the progress of a specific stream of research. Although there are a number of SLR guidelines proposed by existing researchers, there is still too little attention paid to the approach taken and the tools that could be applied throughout the SLR process. Therefore, this paper attempted to fill the gap by presenting the application of Data Analytics approach in the SLR with the utilization of data mining and text mining technique. It proposed a step-by-step procedure using data analytics approach, and recommended tools to be used in the SLR process. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, the authors selected a Master Data Management research domain as a case study. Based on this particular application, it can be concluded that this approach is a replicable, effective and output-based approach in conducting an SLR. It is hoped that other researchers would be able to replicate this approach in doing SLR for other research domains such as software engineering and information technology fields of study. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

N2  - American cities have been implementing park-and-rides (PNRs) since the 1930s; however, there has been a recent resurgence of literature examining this type of transit station. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on PNRs and directions for future research. PNR studies published in the last ten years were reviewed and text mining was applied to extract key themes. Six themes were identified. The two most common areas of research were network equilibrium and optimization (12 of 37 studies) and demand models (8 of 37 studies). This was followed by guidelines and best practices as well as comparative studies (6 of 37 studies each). Parking utilization had the fewest number of recent studies (3 of 37 studies). This review revealed that the majority of PNR studies were conducted in geographic areas with extensive transit services, most studies have focused on rail-based PNRs, and the most widely used method was multinomial logit. Some areas for future research include studying remote PNRs, examining bus-based PNRs, and assessing the impact of emerging modes on PNR utilization. This systematic review could assist planners and transit agencies in further improving sustainable PNR networks in their cities. © 2021 Antora Mohsena Haque, Candace Brakewood, Shahrbanoo Rezaei & Anahita Khojandi.

N2  - Objectives Describe characteristics of rapid reviews and examine the impact of methodological variations on their reliability and validity. Study Design and Setting We conducted a literature review and interviews with organizations that produce rapid reviews or related products to identify methods, guidance, empiric evidence, and current practices. Results We identified 36 rapid products from 20 organizations (production time, 5 minutes to 8 months). Methods differed from systematic reviews at all stages. As time frames increased, methods became more rigorous; however, restrictions on database searching, inclusion criteria, data extracted, and independent dual review remained. We categorized rapid products based on extent of synthesis. "Inventories" list what evidence is available. "Rapid responses" present best available evidence with no formal synthesis. "Rapid reviews" synthesize the quality of and findings from the evidence. "Automated approaches" generate meta-analyses in response to user-defined queries. Rapid products rely on a close relationship with end users and support specific decisions in an identified time frame. Limited empiric evidence exists comparing rapid and systematic reviews. Conclusions Rapid products have tremendous methodological variation; categorization based on time frame or type of synthesis reveals patterns. The similarity across rapid products lies in the close relationship with the end user to meet time-sensitive decision-making needs. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine will generate numerous application possibilities to improve patient care, provide real-time data analytics, and enable continuous patient monitoring. Clinicians and health informaticians should become familiar with machine learning and deep learning. Additionally, they should have a strong background in data analytics and data visualization to use, evaluate, and develop AI applications in clinical practice. Objective: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the current state of AI training and the use of AI tools to enhance the learning experience. Methods: A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to analyze the use of AI in medical and health informatics education, and to evaluate existing AI training practices. PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols) guidelines were followed. The studies that focused on the use of AI tools to enhance medical education and the studies that investigated teaching AI as a new competency were categorized separately to evaluate recent developments. Results: This systematic review revealed that recent publications recommend the integration of AI training into medical and health informatics curricula. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review exploring the current state of AI education in both medicine and health informatics. Since AI curricula have not been standardized and competencies have not been determined, a framework for specialized AI training in medical and health informatics education is proposed. © A Hasan Sapci, H Aylin Sapci.

N2  - Background: Lack of sleep generates many disorders and bruxism is one of them. It has affected almost 31% of the world population. Aim: The purpose of this paper is to determine the volume of the research conducted on bruxism and to create a database. We aimed to highlight critical issues for further research commitments and communications. This paper designs a comprehensive and very perception-based picture of bruxism disorder. Methods: The research-based work uses three methods, including a systematic mapping process, network visualization, and literature review. Softwares, such as VOSviewer, MATLAB, and ME-GA-X, have been utilized to analyze the work. We have researched deep insights of information to retrieve the present understanding of bruxism disorder from dental to psychological concepts, from engineering detection to clinical treatment, and from temporomandibular disorder to biological genes. Results: We found 10 keywords and 77 items of bruxism in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases based on previous publications. These keywords and items are helpful for all types of researchers, which include engineering, science, and medical background personals. 11 genes and 75 research articles with approximately 115,077 subjects, for the analysis of detection, treatment, child and adolescent bruxism, have been reviewed in the research work. Conclusion: It has been found that bruxism altogether has sleep, neurological, dental, and genetic disorder components and is a complex phenomenon. This study has also mentioned the future direction and gap in research conducted so far on bruxism and has also tried to provide goals for the up-coming research to be accomplished in a more significant and scientific manner. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Background: Over the past decade, clinical care has become globally dependent on information technology. The cybersecurity of health care information systems is now an essential component of safe, reliable, and effective health care delivery. Objective: The objective of this study was to provide an overview of the literature at the intersection of cybersecurity and health care delivery. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science for English-language peer-reviewed articles. We carried out chronological analysis, domain clustering analysis, and text analysis of the included articles to generate a high-level concept map composed of specific words and the connections between them. Results: Our final sample included 472 English-language journal articles. Our review results revealed that majority of the articles were focused on technology: Technology–focused articles made up more than half of all the clusters, whereas managerial articles accounted for only 32% of all clusters. This finding suggests that nontechnological variables (human–based and organizational aspects, strategy, and management) may be understudied. In addition, Software Development Security, Business Continuity, and Disaster Recovery Planning each accounted for 3% of the studied articles. Our results also showed that publications on Physical Security account for only 1% of the literature, and research in this area is lacking. Cyber vulnerabilities are not all digital; many physical threats contribute to breaches and potentially affect the physical safety of patients. Conclusions: Our results revealed an overall increase in research on cybersecurity and identified major gaps and opportunities for future work. ©Mohammad S Jalali, Sabina Razak, William Gordon, Eric Perakslis, Stuart Madnick.

PD  - 
N2  - Systematic literature review (SLR) is an important method for identifying, evaluating, and summarizing a specific research subject. However, a SLR study always faces validity threats because there exist subjective biases in certain steps of a SLR, such as identification of relevant studies and primary study selection. In software engineering field, many systematic review studies have adopted several methods to increase the reliability, for example, group decision and pilots search. In this paper, in order to reduce subjective biases, we propose a different solution to improve objectively the quality of SLR, which aims to apply text similarity analysis into two stages of a SLR. We propose that the synonym and hypernym relations of WordNet can be used to expand the search strings to improve the paper search process. In addition, through calculating the relevance of a paper and research issues according to text similarity analysis, the primary study selection can be improved. Then, through the experiment, we validate the effectiveness of our method. Our work provides a preliminary exploration of the combination of text similarity analysis and SLR in order to improve the quality of a SLR. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

N2  - Background: With the rapid development of information and communication technologies, smart homes are being investigated as effective solutions for home health care. The increasing academic attention on smart home health care has primarily been on the development and application of smart home technologies. However, comprehensive studies examining the general landscape of diverse research areas for smart home health care are still lacking. Objective: This study aims to determine the intellectual structure of smart home health care in a time series by conducting a coword analysis and topic analysis. Specifically, it investigates (1) the intellectual basis of smart home health care through overall academic status, (2) the intellectual foci through influential keywords and their evolutions, and (3) intellectual trends through primary topics and their evolutions. Methods: Analyses were conducted in 5 steps: (1) data retrieval from article databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed) and the initial dataset preparation of 6080 abstracts from the year 2000 to the first half of 2019; (2) data preprocessing and refinement extraction of 25,563 words; (3) a descriptive analysis of the overall academic status and period division (ie, 4 stages of 3-year blocks); (4) coword analysis based on word co-occurrence networks for the intellectual foci; and (5) topic analysis for the intellectual trends based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling, word-topic networks, and researcher workshops. Results: First, regarding the intellectual basis of smart home health care, recent academic interest and predominant journals and research domains were verified. Second, to determine the intellectual foci, primary keywords were identified and classified according to the degree of their centrality values. Third, 5 themes pertaining to the topic evolution emerged: (1) the diversification of smart home health care research topics; (2) the shift from technology-oriented research to technological convergence research; (3) the expansion of application areas and system functionality of smart home health care; (4) the increased focus on system usability, such as service design and experiences; and (5) the recent adaptation of the latest technologies in health care. Based on these findings, the pattern of technology diffusion in smart home health care research was determined as the adaptation of technologies, the proliferation of application areas, and an extension into system design and service experiences. Conclusions: The research findings provide academic and practical value in 3 aspects. First, they promote a comprehensive understanding of the smart home health care domain by identifying its multifaceted intellectual structure in a time series. Second, they can help clinicians discern the development and dispersion level of their respective disciplines. Third, the pattern of technologydiffusion in smart home health care could help scholars comprehend current and future research trends and identify research opportunities based on upcoming research waves of newly adapted technologies in smart home health care. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

N2  - Natural language processing (NLP) is gaining momentum in management research for its ability to automatically analyze and comprehend human language. Yet, despite its extensive application in management research, there is neither a comprehensive review of extant literature on such applications, nor is there a detailed walkthrough on how it can be employed as an analytical technique. To this end, we review articles in the UT Dallas List of 24 Leading Business Journals that employ NLP as their focal analytical technique to elucidate how textual data can be harnessed for advancing management theories across multiple disciplines. We describe the available toolkits and procedural steps for employing NLP as an analytical technique as well as its advantages and disadvantages. In so doing, we highlight the managerial and technological challenges associated with the application of NLP in management research in order to guide future inquires. © 2020, © 2020 Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

N2  - Systematic reviews are a widely used method to provide an overview over the current scientific consensus, by bringing together multiple studies in a reliable, transparent way. The large and growing number of published studies, and their increasing rate of publication, makes the task of identifying all relevant studies in an unbiased way both complex and time consuming to the extent that jeopardizes the validity of their findings and the ability to inform policy and practice in a timely manner. The CLEF 2017 e-Health Lab Task 2 focuses on the efficient and effective ranking of studies during the abstract and title screening phase of conducting Diagnostic Test Accuracy systematic reviews. We constructed a benchmark collection of fifty such reviews and the corresponding relevant and irrelevant articles found by the original Boolean query. Fourteen teams participated in the task, submitting 68 automatic and semi-automatic runs, using information retrieval and machine learning algorithms over a variety of text representations, in a batch and iterative manner. This paper reports both the methodology used to construct the benchmark collection, and the results of the evaluation.

The large and growing number of published studies, and their increasing rate of publication, makes the task of identifying all relevant studies in an unbiased way both complex and time consuming to the extent that jeopardizes the validity of their findings and the ability to inform policy and practice in a timely manner. The CLEF 2019 e-Health TAR Lab accommodated two tasks. Task 1 focused on retrieving relevant studies from PubMed without the use of a Boolean query, while Task 2 focused on the efficient and effective ranking of studies during the abstract and title screening phase of conducting a systematic review. In the 2019 lab we also expanded upon the type of systematics reviews considered. Hence, beyond Diagnostic Test Accuracy reviews, we also included Intervention, Prognosis, and Qualitative systematic reviews. We constructed a benchmark collection of 31 reviews published by Cochrane, and the corresponding relevant and irrelevant articles found by the original Boolean query. Three teams participated in Task 2, submitting automatic and semi-automatic runs, using information retrieval and machine learning algorithms over a variety of text representations, in a batch and iterative manner.

N2  - Background: The environmental health community needs transparent, methodologically rigorous, and rapid approaches for updating human health risk assessments. These assessments often contain reference values for cancer and/or noncancer effects. Increasingly, the use of systematic review methods are preferred when developing these assessments. Systematic evidence maps are a type of analysis that has the potential to be very helpful in the update process, especially when combined with machine-learning software advances designed to expedite the process of conducting a review. Objectives: To evaluate the applicability of evidence mapping to determine whether new evidence is likely to result in a change to an existing health reference value, using inhalation exposure to the air pollutant acrolein as a case example. Methods: New literature published since the 2008 California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) Reference Exposure Level (REL) for acrolein was assessed. Systematic review methods were used to search the literature and screening included the use of machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify studies that characterized acute and chronic exposure and could be informative for hazard characterization. Studies that met the PECO criteria after full-text review were briefly summarized before their suitability for chronic point of departure (POD) derivation and calculation of a reference value was considered. Studies considered potentially suitable underwent a targeted evaluation to determine their suitability for use in dose–response analysis. Results: Over 15,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Both machine-learning and manual screening processes were used to identify 60 studies considered PECO-relevant after full-text review. Most of these PECO-relevant studies were short-term exposure animal studies (acute or less than 1 month of exposure) and considered less suitable for deriving a chronic reference value when compared to the subchronic study in rats used in the 2008 OEHHA assessment. Thirteen epidemiological studies were identified but had limitations in the exposure assessment that made them less suitable for dose–response compared to the subchronic rat study. Among the 13 studies, there were four controlled trial studies that have the potential to be informative for future acute reference value derivation. Thus, the 2008 subchronic rat study used by OEHHA appears to still be the most appropriate study for chronic reference value derivation. In addition, advances in dosimetric modeling for gases, including new evidence pertinent to acrolein, could be considered when updating existing acrolein toxicity values. Conclusions: Evidence mapping is a very useful tool to assess the need for updating an assessment based on understanding the potential impact of new studies on revising an existing health reference value. In this case example, the focus was to identify studies suitable for chronic exposure dose–response analysis, while also identifying studies that may be important to consider for acute exposure scenarios, hazard identification, or for future research. This allows the evidence map to be a useful resource for a range of decision-making contexts. Specialized systematic review software increased the efficiency of the process in terms of human resources and time to conduct the analysis. © 2020

N2  - Systematic reviews are a comprehensive and parameterised form of literature review, found in most disciplines, that involve exhaustive analyses and rigorous interpretation of prior literature. Performing systematic reviews, however, can involve repetitive and laborious work in order to reach reliable standards. Strict guidelines and availability of published reviews make the task amenable to computerised assistance and automation using text mining, information extraction, and machine learning techniques. However, it is unclear which aspects of this Work Task are best suited for such support. This paper describes a three-month ethnographic study and Cognitive Work Analysis of the systematic reviews performed by a medical research group. Our findings show that the IR aspects of systematic reviews involve many tasks at two separate levels: 1) taxonomic organisation of documents and sub-document elements in relation to topic queries and domain-specific resources, and 2) extraction methods for structured summaries from the classified resources. This provides the basis for future work designing search tools with localised optimization and subtask automation to support specific phases of the process. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - Climate mitigation research puts increasing emphasis on cities, but much more could be learned from urban case studies. The overall size, geographic scope and topic content of cases remains unknown, resulting in few attempts to synthesise the bottom-up evidence. Here, we use scientometric and machine-learning methods to produce a comprehensive map of the literature. Our database of approximately 4,000 case studies provides a wealth of evidence to search, compare and review. We find that cities in world regions with the highest future mitigation relevance are systematically underrepresented. A map of the evidence allows case studies to be matched with urban typologies in new and more ambitious forms of synthesis, bringing together traditionally separate strands of qualitative and quantitative urban research. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Remanufacturing within the automotive industry has become an important part of environmental and reusability efforts. A crucial aspect of the remanufacturing process workflow is the correct identification and classification of defects on the product. A comprehensive ontology was developed based on a literature review to define, distinguish, and prioritize various defects for the remanufacturing of cylinder heads to show the relationships between them. Furthermore, the opinions of experts who work with or within the remanufacturing industry were surveyed. Text-mining methods and input from standards documents where applicable were used to confirm and extend the ontology for defect classification in remanufacturing. Results from these efforts show that these methods can provide sufficient supplemental knowledge to validate critical or underdeveloped areas of ontology. Expert opinions are extremely valuable in communicating information that is not discussed in scholarly articles and in contributing to the process of validating information found in scholarly articles. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

N2  - As part of the forefront of evidence-based medicine, a systematic review (SR) identifies, appraises, and synthesizes all the available literature relevant to a question of interest in a transparent and systematic way. A time-consuming step in conducting systematic review (SR) is the manual article screening from a list of potentially relevant articles retrieved by librarians. In this study, we propose a multi-level SR supporting framework including three levels: Level 1 - ranking with multiple metrics aiming to assist the screening process by increasing the efficiency without compromising the validity; Level 2 - topic analysis for discovering distributed semantics; and Level 3 - network analysis on relation extracted for comprehensive semantic summarization. The sensitivities in two case studies for relevance ranking reached above 80%, while the screening burdens were lowered to 25% based on a crude relevance ranking approach. Topic analysis based on Latent Dirichlet Allocations (LDAs) showed high consistency among the domain experts' selection of articles. The predicate relation network summarized important predicate relations between medical concepts. © 2014 IEEE.

PD  - 
N2  - The COVID-19 outbreak, along with post-pandemic impact has prompted Internet Plus education to re-examine numerous facets of technology-oriented academic research, particularly Educational Big Data (EBD). However, the unexpected transition from face-to-face offline education to online lessons has urged teachers to introduce educational technology into teaching practice, which has had an overwhelming impact on teachers' professional and personal lives. The aim of this present work is to fathom which research foci construct EBD in a comprehensive manner and how positive psychological indicators function in the technostress suffered by less agentic teachers. To this end, CiteSpace 5.7 and VOSviewer were applied to examine a longitudinal study of the literature from Web of Science Core Collection with the objective of uncovering the explicit patterns and knowledge structures in scientific network knowledge maps. Thousand seven hundred and eight articles concerned with educational data that met the criteria were extracted and analyzed. Research spanning 15 years was conducted to reveal that the knowledge base has accumulated dramatically after many governments' initiatives since 2012 with an accelerating annual growth and decreasing geographic imbalance. The review also identified some influential authors and journals whose effects will continue to have future implications. The authors identified several topical foci such as data mining, student performance, learning environment and psychology, learning analytics, and application. More specifically, the authors identified the scientific shift from data mining application to data privacy and educational psychology, from general scan to specific investigation. Among the conclusions, the results highlighted the important integration of educational psychology and technology during critical periods of educational development. Copyright © 2021 Li and Jiang.

N2  - The evidence-based approach has increasingly been employed to synthesize empirical findings from the primary research in software engineering. Nevertheless, the reproducibility of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) studies seems to be underemphasized. In our investigation into the automatic search of 311 sample studies, more than 50% of the search strings are not reusable; about 87.5% of the search activities (e.g., search field settings) are unrepeatable; and more than 95% of the whole automatic search implementations are unreproducible. Considering that searching is a cornerstone of an EBSE study, we are afraid that the reproducibility of the current secondary research could be worse than we can imagine. By analyzing and reporting the root causes of the aforementioned observations, we urge collaboration and cooperation among all the stakeholders in our community to improve the research reproducibility in EBSE. © 2021 IEEE.

N2  - Conversational agents are systems with human-like features that can be deployed in service settings and are fast emerging as the future of online commerce. Considering the importance and proliferation of conversational commerce, it is opportune to take stock of the field's research from a bird's eye view to guide understanding of its current and future progress. In this regard, the goal of this study is to review the performance and intellectual structure of conversational commerce. To do so, this study conducts a comprehensive and systematic review of 722 publications on conversational commerce using the Scientific Procedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews protocol and a collection of bibliometric analysis techniques consisting of performance analysis and science mapping (e.g., content analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and bibliographic coupling). In doing so, this study reveals the performance (e.g., publication and citation trends, and top sources, publications, and authors) and the major theories and themes in the intellectual structure of the field. The study concludes with a conceptual framework depicting the constructs (e.g., antecedents, mediators, moderators, consequences, and enablers) of employing conversational agents for commerce and service delivery, as well as suggestions for its future research. © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Literature reviews play an essential role in academic research to gather existing knowledge and to examine the state of a field. However, researchers in business, management and related disciplines continue to rely on cursory and narrative reviews that lack a systematic investigation of the literature. This article details methodological steps for conducting literature reviews in a replicable and scientific fashion. This article also discusses bibliographic mapping approaches to visualise bibliometric information and findings from a systematic literature review. We hope that the insights provided in this article are useful for researchers at different stages of their careers – ranging from doctoral students who wish to assemble a broad overview of their field of interest to guide their work, to senior researchers who wish to publish authoritative literature reviews.

N2  - The CONSORT 2010 (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomised trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency when evaluating new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI. Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process, involving a literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed on in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items, which were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions, that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human-AI interaction and providing analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer-reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes. ©

PD  - 
N2  - As service design thinking in public services has increasingly attracted attention for producing innovative solutions to wicked problems, its application promises great potentials in creating better and more responsive services. However, there is no comprehensive review on the topic specifically on service design for the fields of public health and public administration. Based on the current discussions on the value of design for public health and public administration, the paper presents a systematic literature review into the specific discussions on service design, with the purpose to provide better public service innovations, especially in the context of recognizing the human needs in the technological digital advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, and Cloud Computing. The paper outlines the areas of applications, issues, and challenges for future research and policy innovations. By analyzing top keywords and authors from 529 articles, collected from the Web of Science database, the scientometric study reveals an emerging loose network of concepts and authors. Although the impact of such work remains limited at its early stage of development, the combination of both human-centered insights and system thinking processes at the organization levels, brought by the service design approach, has shown to tackle some of the wicked problems of public health and public administration. Future research and design workshops can be conducted to reinvigorate the notion of people-centered commitments for public service innovations, with societal relevance and scientific rigor. © 2020 IEEE.

PD  - 
N2  - Context: Both scientific publications and grey literature have widely been employed as sources of empirical evidence in evidence-based software engineering (EBSE). However, there is still a fierce debate about whether or not the pervasive Web content can act as an alternative means to gather evidence for EBSE. Aim: To help ourselves enter this debate, this work aims to obtain some pre-evidence of reviewing Web documents for verifying the value and reliability of online materials. Method: Given the unique characteristics of Web content, we adapted the traditional Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology in EBSE, and conducted a review case study in the deep learning domain. Results: Our study selected four different search sources and captured 5082 'deep learning'-relevant Web documents. After a set of thematic synthesis steps ranging from keyword identification to brainstorming, the collected raw data were eventually evolved into a mind map of six semantic topics. Conclusions: We confirm that Web content can provide valuable information as supplementary evidence in EBSE. However, reviewing Web content introduces more search source bias rather than academic publications' location bias that is due to factors like ease of access or indexing levels in digital libraries. © 2017 IEEE.

N2  - In the present era of data analytics, industries leverage the power embedded in the abundant data generated rapidly to improve procedures and facilitate decision making. The architectural, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) industry as well, begins to realize the benefits of data-driven approaches. However, AEC/FM is still behind many other industries in leveraging the advantages of data. During the last decade, researchers have focused their attention to emerging construction trends such as building information modeling (BIM). Integrated with data analytics, such trends have high potential to continue the technology evolution of the industry. This paper consolidates the records of current relevant efforts in AEC/FM academic research and evaluates the conclusions from this literature exploration through an industry survey. Following a comprehensive literature review, a three dimensional evidenced taxonomy was developed by categorizing the primary concepts into related segments that maps: (1) data analytics concepts such as cloud computing and machine learning, onto (2) AEC/FM emerging trends such as BIM and automation, and (3) existing and potential AEC/FM applications such as safety and progress monitoring. The same categorization was used to conduct the survey. Statistical analysis of the survey results indicates a general agreement between the literature-based identified technology trends and application areas that can benefit from data. BIM exhibited the most promising Technology Trend when integrated with data analytics in both literature and industry surveys. As for the application areas, process efficiency and productivity improvement ranked the highest in the literature and industry survey, respectively. This study contributes to the body of knowledge and practice by creating an evidenced account of the existing frameworks that benefit from data analytics and future potentials from both the academic and industry standpoints. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

N2  - Machine learning (ML) algorithms have proven highly accurate for identifying Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) but are not used much in practice, in part because the best way to make use of the technology in a typical workflow is unclear. In this work, we evaluate ML models for RCT classification (support vector machines, convolutional neural networks, and ensemble approaches). We trained and optimized support vector machine and convolutional neural network models on the titles and abstracts of the Cochrane Crowd RCT set. We evaluated the models on an external dataset (Clinical Hedges), allowing direct comparison with traditional database search filters. We estimated area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) using the Clinical Hedges dataset. We demonstrate that ML approaches better discriminate between RCTs and non-RCTs than widely used traditional database search filters at all sensitivity levels; our best-performing model also achieved the best results to date for ML in this task (AUROC 0.987, 95% CI, 0.984-0.989). We provide practical guidance on the role of ML in (1) systematic reviews (high-sensitivity strategies) and (2) rapid reviews and clinical question answering (high-precision strategies) together with recommended probability cutoffs for each use case. Finally, we provide open-source software to enable these approaches to be used in practice. © 2018 The Authors. Research Synthesis Methods published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Since critical chain project management (CCPM) was introduced, there have been many reports of its successful application, along with some claims of its shortcomings. However, there has been no attempt to reconcile the often-contradictory claims. To this end, we compiled and analysed a comprehensive database of CCPM scholarly publications. The literature analysis was complemented with text mining using NVivo and Leximancer software. We identify five assumptions CCPM makes about projects, leading to five characteristics that projects need to have for CCPM to apply fully and thus, provide the expected benefits. These characteristics are unity of purpose, fixed 'throughput', urgency, sequential workflow and a non-dedicated team. If projects have these or can be adapted, then they will suit CCPM. Through the process of assumption challenging, this research extends and enhances our understanding of CCPM and its core mechanisms. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

N2  - Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a key tool for evidence-based practice as it combines results from multiple studies of a specific topic of research. Due its characteristics, it is a time consuming, hard process that requires a properly documented protocol for scientific acknowledgment. In this context, this paper presents the SESRA - a web-based automated tool to support all phases of the SLR process, contributing to its productivity and reliability. We also present a use case on the software engineering field, applying specific knowledge to set the process in the discipline. Further, we discuss how to use the tool to establish a more formal and controlled process and to reduce effort on its repetitive activities. The outcomes and feedback obtained in early use have shown that SESRA could support the SLR process, automating some of its key activities. Copyright 2015 ACM.

N2  - Circular economy (CE) and sustainability are interrelated, without being exchangeable. While sustainability tries to reconcile the management of productive resources with their increasing consumption, CE aims to make the productive process more efficient, reducing, reusing and recycling the results of the productive process as much as possible. The aim of this paper is to find out the systemic structure of interactions between sustainability and CE, through the analysis of the existing literature from 2004 to 2021. For this purpose, a computational literature review and content analysis method of CE strategies and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the existing scientific literature has been conducted. It shows that there is a positive impact of the synergy between CE strategies and certain SDGs. All this has led to inclusion in the formulation of policies and strategies, although there is still potential to legislate an even more sustainable framework. © 2021 IEEE.

N2  - Background and Aim: Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have previously been isolated from animals’ testes, cultured in vitro, and successfully transplanted into compatible recipients. The SSC unique characteristic has potential for exploitation as a reproductive tool and this can be achieved through SSC intratesticular transplantation to surrogate sires. Here, we aimed at comprehensively analyzing published data on in vitro maintenance of SSC isolated from the testes of livestock animals and their applications. Materials and Methods: The literature search was performed in PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar electronic databases. Data screening was conducted using Rayyan Intelligent Systematic Review software (https://www.rayyan.ai/). Duplicate papers were excluded from the study. Abstracts were read and relevant full papers were reviewed for data extraction. Results: From a total of 4786 full papers screened, data were extracted from 93 relevant papers. Of these, eight papers reported on long-term culture conditions (>1 month) for SSC in different livestock species, 22 papers on short-term cultures (5-15 days), 10 papers on transfection protocols, 18 papers on transplantation using different methods of preparation of livestock recipients, and five papers on donor-derived spermatogenesis. Conclusion: Optimization of SSC long-term culture systems has renewed the possibilities of utilization of these cells in gene-editing technologies to develop transgenic animals. Further, the development of genetically deficient recipients in the endogenous germline layer lends to a future possibility for the utilization of germ cell transplantation in livestock systems.

N2  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the emerging technologies. In recent decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained widespread acceptance in a variety of fields, including virtual support, healthcare, and security. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field that has been combining AI and human-computer engagement over the past several years in order to create an interactive intelligent system for user interaction. AI, in conjunction with HCI, is being used in a variety of fields by employing various algorithms and employing HCI to provide transparency to the user, allowing them to trust the machine. The comprehensive examination of both the areas of AI and HCI, as well as their subfields, has been explored in this work. The main goal of this article was to discover a point of intersection between the two fields. The understanding of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which is a linking point of HCI and XAI, was gained through a literature review conducted in this research. The literature survey encompassed themes identified in the literature (such as XAI and its areas, major XAI aims, and XAI problems and challenges). The study's other major focus was on the use of AI, HCI, and XAI in healthcare. The poll also addressed the shortcomings in XAI in healthcare, as well as the field's future potential. As a result, the literature indicates that XAI in healthcare is still a novel subject that has to be explored more in the future. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - The last decade has seen rapid developments in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). While research focuses on technical challenges and enablers of AI, the number of publications examining application approaches at the buyer-supplier interface is increasing. To accelerate the related discussion and to add clarity and richness to this fragmented research field, a systematic overview of the existing comprehensive body of literature is essential. We contribute to the academic debate by applying a combined systematic literature review with a text mining and machine learning-based literature review. Thus, we categorize and cluster different research streams and analyze the application of AI at the buyer-supplier interface. Subsequently, we identify gaps resulting from the comparison of the technology and the application domain and derive the main points of discussion from the literature. As a result, we present ten central questions outlining future requirements and research opportunities in the field of AI application at the buyer-supplier interface. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - Systematic reviews in e.g. empirical medicine address research questions by comprehensively examining the entire published literature. Conventionally, manual literature surveys decide inclusion in two steps, first based on abstracts and title, then by full text, yet current methods to automate the process make no distinction between gold data from these two stages. In this work we compare the impact different schemes for choosing positive and negative examples from the different screening stages have on the training of automated systems. We train a ranker using logistic regression and evaluate it on a new gold standard dataset for clinical NLP, and on an existing gold standard dataset for drug class efficacy. The classification and ranking achieves an average AUC of 0.803 and 0.768 when relying on gold standard decisions based on title and abstracts of articles, and an AUC of 0.625 and 0.839 when relying on gold standard decisions based on full text. Our results suggest that it makes little difference which screening stage the gold standard decisions are drawn from, and that the decisions need not be based on the full text. The results further suggest that common-off-the-shelf algorithms can reduce the amount of work required to retrieve relevant literature. © LREC 2018 - 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation.

N2  - This paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art investigation of the recent advances in data science in emerging economic applications. The analysis is performed on the novel data science methods in four individual classes of deep learning models, hybrid deep learning models, hybrid machine learning, and ensemble models. Application domains include a broad and diverse range of economics research from the stock market, marketing, and e-commerce to corporate banking and cryptocurrency. Prisma method, a systematic literature review methodology, is used to ensure the quality of the survey. The findings reveal that the trends follow the advancement of hybrid models, which outperform other learning algorithms. It is further expected that the trends will converge toward the evolution of sophisticated hybrid deep learning models. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - The exponential growth of scientific literature – which we call the ‘big literature’ phenomenon – has created great challenges in literature comprehension and synthesis. The traditional manual literature synthesis processes are often unable to take advantage of big literature due to human limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new literature synthesis methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis approach, automated content analysis (ACA), which has not yet been widely adopted in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine learning tools for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big literature commonly used in the social sciences and in medical research. Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists to ACA and illustrate its capacity to synthesize overwhelming volumes of literature. First, we provide a brief history of the ACA method and summarize the fundamental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA studies to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in synthesizing ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally, we discuss how to maximize the utility and contributions of ACA, as well as potential research directions that may help to advance the use of ACA in future ecological and evolutionary research. Unlike manual methods of literature synthesis, ACA is able to process high volumes of literature at substantially shorter time spans, while helping to mitigate human biases. The overall efficiency and versatility of this method allow for a broad range of applications for literature review and synthesis, including both exploratory reviews and systematic reviews aiming to address more targeted research questions. By allowing for more extensive and comprehensive reviews of big literature, ACA has the potential to fill an important methodological gap and therefore contribute to the advancement of ecological and evolutionary research. © 2016 The Authors.

N2  - There are substantial differences, or variation, between humans in aggression, with its molecular genetic basis mostly unknown. This review summarizes knowledge on the genetic contribution to variation in aggression with the following three foci: (1) a comprehensive overview of reviews on the genetics of human aggression, (2) a systematic review of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), and (3) an automated tool for the selection of literature based on supervised machine learning. The phenotype definition 'aggression' (or 'aggressive behaviour', or 'aggression-related traits') included anger, antisocial behaviour, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder. The literature search was performed in multiple databases, manually and using a novel automated selection tool, resulting in 18 reviews and 17 GWASs of aggression. Heritability estimates of aggression in children and adults are around 50%, with relatively small fluctuations around this estimate. In 17 GWASs, 817 variants were reported as suggestive (P ≤ 1.0E-05), including 10 significant associations (P ≤ 5.0E-08). Nominal associations (P ≤ 1E-05) were found in gene-based tests for genes involved in immune, endocrine, and nervous systems. Associations were not replicated across GWASs. A complete list of variants and their position in genes and chromosomes are available online. The automated literature search tool produced literature not found by regular search strategies. Aggression in humans is heritable, but its genetic basis remains to be uncovered. No sufficiently large GWASs have been carried out yet. With increases in sample size, we expect aggression to behave like other complex human traits for which GWAS has been successful. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health. All rights reserved.

N2  - Female Entrepreneurship has gained interest over the last 20 years. Therefore, this paper analyses 7, 320 articles of the research field 'women in entrepreneurial context' published in 885 journals. The sample is analyzed by using a machine learning and text mining based methodological approach. Aiming to provide a broad overview over the research literature, 41 clusters and 11 superordinate topics were identified. Major developments of research attention are outlined by analyzing bibliometric data of the period from 2000 to 2020. Overall growth in terms of research attention measured by the development of yearly citations per article is best noticeable in clusters 'corporate social responsibility', 'brand', and 'corporate (-governance)', and in superordinate topics 'performance', 'education', and 'corporate (board/ management)'. There are also indicators for an overall increase of research attention and cluster variety. The synthesis provides an insight into most trending superordinate topics. Therefore, this literature review gives a comprehensive and descriptive overview as well as an insight into thematic trend developments of the research field. © 2021 IEEE.

N2  - Background:: Statistical validity and model complexity are both important concepts to enhanced understanding and correctness assessment of computational models. However, information about these are often missing from publications applying machine learning. Aim: The aim of this study is to show the importance of providing details that can indicate statistical validity and complexity of models in publications. This is explored in the context of citation screening automation using machine learning techniques. Method: We built 15 Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, each developed using word2vec (average word) features - and data for 15 review topics from the Drug Evaluation Review Program (DERP) of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Results: The word2vec features were found to be sufficiently linearly separable by the SVM and consequently we used the linear kernels. In 11 of the 15 models, the negative (majority) class used over 80% of its training data as support vectors (SVs) and approximately 45% of the positive training data. Conclusions: In this context, exploring the SVs revealed that the models are overly complex against ideal expectations of not more than 2%-5% (and preferably much less) of the training vectors. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - Background: Since the introduction of the systematic review process to Software Engineering in 2004, researchers have investigated a number of ways to mitigate the amount of effort and time taken to filter through large volumes of literature. Aim: This study aims to provide a critical analysis of text mining techniques used to support the citation screening stage of the systematic review process. Method: We critically re-reviewed papers included in a previous systematic review which addressed the use of text mining methods to support the screening of papers for inclusion in a review. The previous review did not provide a detailed analysis of the text mining methods used. We focus on the availability in the papers of information about the text mining methods employed, including the description and explanation of the methods, parameter settings, assessment of the appropriateness of their application given the size and dimensionality of the data used, performance on training, testing and validation data sets, and further information that may support the reproducibility of the included studies. Results: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Committee of classifiers (Ensemble) are the most used classification algorithms. In all of the studies, features were represented with Bag-of-Words (BOW) using both binary features (28%) and term frequency (66%). Five studies experimented with n-grams with n between 2 and 4, but mostly the unigram was used. ?2, information gain and tf-idf were the most commonly used feature selection techniques. Feature extraction was rarely used although LDA and topic modelling were used. Recall, precision, F and AUC were the most used metrics and cross validation was also well used. More than half of the studies used a corpus size of below 1,000 documents for their experiments while corpus size for around 80% of the studies was 3,000 or fewer documents. The major common ground we found for comparing performance assessment based on independent replication of studies was the use of the same dataset but a sound performance comparison could not be established because the studies had little else in common. In most of the studies, insufficient information was reported to enable independent replication. The studies analysed generally did not include any discussion of the statistical appropriateness of the text mining method that they applied. In the case of applications of SVM, none of the studies report the number of support vectors that they found to indicate the complexity of the prediction engine that they use, making it impossible to judge the extent to which over-fitting might account for the good performance results. Conclusions: There is yet to be concrete evidence about the effectiveness of text mining algorithms regarding their use in the automation of citation screening in systematic reviews. The studies indicate that options are still being explored, but there is a need for better reporting as well as more explicit process details and access to datasets to facilitate study replication for evidence strengthening. In general, the reader often gets the impression that text mining algorithms were applied as magic tools in the reviewed papers, relying on default settings or default optimization of available machine learning toolboxes without an in-depth understanding of the statistical validity and appropriateness of such tools for text mining purposes. © 2016 ACM.

N2  - With the extensive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), construction engineering and management (CEM) is experiencing a rapid digital transformation. Since AI-based solutions in CEM has become the current research focus, it needs to be comprehensively understood. In this regard, this paper presents a systematic review under both scientometric and qualitative analysis to present the current state of AI adoption in the context of CEM and discuss its future research trends. To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473 journal articles published in 1997–2020. It is found that there has been an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2) information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Buildings are responsible for about 30–40% of global energy demand. At the same time, we humans spend almost our entire life, up to 80–90% of the time, inside of buildings. Reducing energy demand through optimal operation is the subject of building control research, while human satisfaction in buildings is studied in the thermal comfort community. Thus, balancing the two is necessary for a sustainable and comfortable building stock. We review both research fields and their relationship using a data-driven approach. Based on specific search terms, all relevant abstracts from the Web Of Science database are downloaded and analyzed using the text mining software VOSviewer. We visualize the scientific landscapes of historic and recent trends, and analyze the citation network to investigate the interaction between thermal comfort and building control research. We find that building control focuses predominantly on energy savings rather than incorporating results from thermal comfort, especially when it comes to occupant satisfaction. We identify potential research directions in terms of bridging the two fields. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - To improve the search functionality of online sound effect libraries, timbral information could be extracted using perceptual models, and added as metadata, allowing users to filter results by timbral characteristics. This paper identifies the timbral attributes that end-users commonly search for, to indicate the attributes that might usefully be modelled for automatic metadata generation. A literature review revealed 1187 descriptors that were subsequently reduced to a hierarchy of 145 timbral attributes. This hierarchy covered the timbral characteristics of source types and modifiers including musical instruments, speech, environmental sounds, and sound recording and reproduction systems. A part-manual, part-automated comparison between the hierarchy and a freesound.org search history indicated that the timbral attributes hardness, depth, and brightness occur in searches most frequently.

N2  - Background: Patient healthcare trajectory is a recent emergent topic in the literature, encompassing broad concepts. However, the rationale for studying patients' trajectories, and how this trajectory concept is defined remains a public health challenge. Our research was focused on patients' trajectories based on disease management and care, while also considering medico-economic aspects of the associated management. We illustrated this concept with an example: a myocardial infarction (MI) occurring in a patient's hospital trajectory of care. The patient follow-up was traced via the prospective payment system. We applied a semi-automatic text mining process to conduct a comprehensive review of patient healthcare trajectory studies. This review investigated how the concept of trajectory is defined, studied and what it achieves. Methods: We performed a PubMed search to identify reports that had been published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 2000 and October 31, 2015. Fourteen search questions were formulated to guide our review. A semi-automatic text mining process based on a semantic approach was performed to conduct a comprehensive review of patient healthcare trajectory studies. Text mining techniques were used to explore the corpus in a semantic perspective in order to answer non-a priori questions. Complementary review methods on a selected subset were used to answer a priori questions. Results: Among the 33,514 publications initially selected for analysis, only 70 relevant articles were semi-automatically extracted and thoroughly analysed. Oncology is particularly prevalent due to its already well-established processes of care. For the trajectory thema, 80% of articles were distributed in 11 clusters. These clusters contain distinct semantic information, for example health outcomes (29%), care process (26%) and administrative and financial aspects (16%). Conclusion: This literature review highlights the recent interest in the trajectory concept. The approach is also gradually being used to monitor trajectories of care for chronic diseases such as diabetes, organ failure or coronary artery and MI trajectory of care, to improve care and reduce costs. Patient trajectory is undoubtedly an essential approach to be further explored in order to improve healthcare monitoring. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

N2  - This work aims to analyze and reveal critical features of the papers published since 1990 on the topic of masonry structures under earthquake loading. In particular, detailed information for nearly three thousand papers (exactly 2909) was extracted from the Scopus database [1], and investigated in two stages. Initially, the papers were analyzed in terms of simple statistics and keyword time series – as either raw or normalized data – in order to describe the evolution of the relevant research during the past twenty-seven years (1990-2016, inclusive). In a second phase, bibliometric maps of the papers were developed, regarding their similarities with respect to a variety of the papers' characteristics such as: author keywords and author names. The resulting diagrams constitute comprehensive maps of the relevant literature, with respect to the associations among the particular characteristics. The bibliometric maps were constructed based on a rigorous methodology, which converts each item (for example, keyword) to a two-dimensional (x, y) point on the bibliometric map. These distances between items reflect the dissimilarities between them, for a particular characteristic. The numerical procedure involved in the construction of the map is a constrained optimization problem which was formulated and solved with an efficient methodology.

N2  - The objective of this work is to use machine learning techniques to analyze a big database of papers published since 1990 regarding the conservation of masonry buildings considered as historical heritage. In this study, a database of nearly three thousand papers obtained from Scopus database [1] were investigated. In a first stage, the papers are analyzed using basic statistics in order to describe the evolution of the research during the past thirty years. In the second stage, Genetic Algorithms (GA) were implemented to create bibliometric maps for the visualization of co-word analysis that was performed using the provided database. The obtained diagrams constitute comprehensive maps of relevant characteristics among the investigated literature such as similarities between author keywords or author names. The maps are constructed using a rigorous methodology that involves the mapping of each item (for example, a keyword) to a two-dimensional point. The distances between the items represent their dissimilarity for a specific characteristic. The numerical procedure for the construction of the bibliometric map involves an optimization task solved by means of GA. The obtained result is a powerful tool for data analysis, which provides a deep insight of relevant characteristics of a large database in a very short time. Copyright © 2019 COMPDYN Proceedings.

TI  - In search of better science: on the epistemic costs of systematic reviews and the need for a pluralistic stance to literature search
AU  - Polonioli, A.
PY  - 2020
PD  - 
N2  - This paper reviews the current status of academic search engines and emerging trends in scientific information retrieval and argues for two key claims. First, since systematic searches rely on the widespread use of academic search engines and the latter are generally not powered by cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) and not well-positioned to further the goals of findability and discoverability, there are some non-trivial epistemic costs associated with the tradition of systematic search. Second, while narrative reviews are typically criticized because of their lack of transparency, accountability, and reproducibility, they do deserve a place in scientific research. Specifically, once narrative reviews are properly understood as enabled by modern tools such as non-academic search engines, AI-powered recommender systems and academic social networks, it is possible to appreciate how these can indeed further the goal of literature discoverability. The upshot of this piece is that there are multiple goals and trade-offs involved in the process of scientific document search and that we should acknowledge virtues and limitations of different approaches to information retrieval and be prepared to welcome their combined use. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

N2  - By providing knowledge contributions and stimulating future research, review articles (RAs) play a vital role for cumulative knowledge development. Although many papers cite RAs, it is rarely transparent to which degree citation impact represents perfunctory citations as opposed to a deeper engagement with a RA's knowledge contributions. This distinction between perfunctory and ideational impact has largely been neglected in the literature arguably because of the manual effort required for qualitative analysis. Against this background, our study aims at developing automated classifiers of ideational impact of IS RAs. We propose a machine learning model based on natural language processing to evaluate the feasibility of automated analyses. The evaluation results provide evidence for an effective and scalable classification approach that presents a reliable and reproducible solution to the ideational impact classification problem. We discuss implications for improving the capabilities of understanding how IS scholars build on their field's body of knowledge. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.

N2  - Screening references is a time-consuming step necessary for systematic reviews and guideline development. Previous studies have shown that human effort can be reduced by using machine learning software to prioritise large reference collections such that most of the relevant references are identified before screening is completed. We describe and evaluate RobotAnalyst, a Web-based software system that combines text-mining and machine learning algorithms for organising references by their content and actively prioritising them based on a relevancy classification model trained and updated throughout the process. We report an evaluation over 22 reference collections (most are related to public health topics) screened using RobotAnalyst with a total of 43 610 abstract-level decisions. The number of references that needed to be screened to identify 95% of the abstract-level inclusions for the evidence review was reduced on 19 of the 22 collections. Significant gains over random sampling were achieved for all reviews conducted with active prioritisation, as compared with only two of five when prioritisation was not used. RobotAnalyst's descriptive clustering and topic modelling functionalities were also evaluated by public health analysts. Descriptive clustering provided more coherent organisation than topic modelling, and the content of the clusters was apparent to the users across a varying number of clusters. This is the first large-scale study using technology-assisted screening to perform new reviews, and the positive results provide empirical evidence that RobotAnalyst can accelerate the identification of relevant studies. The results also highlight the issue of user complacency and the need for a stopping criterion to realise the work savings. © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - The purpose of this research is to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature in the field of 'Supply Chain Risk Management' and identify important research gaps for potential research. Furthermore, a conceptual risk management framework is also proposed that encompasses holistic view of the field. 'Systematic Literature Review' method is used to examine quality articles published over a time period of almost 15 years (2000 - June, 2014). The findings of the study are validated through text mining software. Systematic literature review has identified the progress of research based on various descriptive and thematic typologies. The review and text mining analysis have also provided an insight into major research gaps. Based on the identified gaps, a framework is developed that can help researchers model interdependencies between risk factors. © 2015 IEEE.

N2  - Background: Research on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into community-based primary health care (CBPHC) has highlighted several advantages and disadvantages in practice regarding, for example, facilitating diagnosis and disease management, as well as doubts concerning the unintended harmful effects of this integration. However, there is a lack of evidence about a comprehensive knowledge synthesis that could shed light on AI systems tested or implemented in CBPHC. Objective: We intended to identify and evaluate published studies that have tested or implemented AI in CBPHC settings. Methods: We conducted a systematic scoping review informed by an earlier study and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review framework and reported the findings according to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-Scoping Reviews) reporting guidelines. An information specialist performed a comprehensive search from the date of inception until February 2020, in seven bibliographic databases: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore. The selected studies considered all populations who provide and receive care in CBPHC settings, AI interventions that had been implemented, tested, or both, and assessed outcomes related to patients, health care providers, or CBPHC systems. Risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the identified records, read the selected full texts, and extracted data from the included studies using a validated extraction form. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and if this was not possible, the opinion of a third reviewer was sought. A third reviewer also validated all the extracted data. Results: We retrieved 22,113 documents. After the removal of duplicates, 16,870 documents were screened, and 90 peer-reviewed publications met our inclusion criteria. Machine learning (ML) (41/90, 45%), natural language processing (NLP) (24/90, 27%), and expert systems (17/90, 19%) were the most commonly studied AI interventions. These were primarily implemented for diagnosis, detection, or surveillance purposes. Neural networks (ie, convolutional neural networks and abductive networks) demonstrated the highest accuracy, considering the given database for the given clinical task. The risk of bias in diagnosis or prognosis studies was the lowest in the participant category (4/49, 4%) and the highest in the outcome category (22/49, 45%). Conclusions: We observed variabilities in reporting the participants, types of AI methods, analyses, and outcomes, and highlighted the large gap in the effective development and implementation of AI in CBPHC. Further studies are needed to efficiently guide the development and implementation of AI interventions in CBPHC settings. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.

N2  - The quantitative study of science, technology and innovation (ST&I science, technology, and innovation (STI)) has experienced significant growth with advancements in disciplines such as mathematics, computer science and information sciences. From the early studies utilizing the statistics method, graph theory, to citations or co-authorship, the state of the art in quantitative methods leverages natural language processing and machine learning. However, there is no unified methodological approach within the research community or a comprehensive understanding of how to exploit text-mining potentials to address ST&I research objectives. Therefore, this chapter intends to present the state of the art of text mining within the framework of ST&I. The major contribution of the chapter is twofold; first, it provides a review of the literature on how text mining extended the quantitative methods applied in ST&I and highlights major methodological challenges. Second, it discusses two hands-on detailed case studies on how to implement the text analytics routine. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

N2  - Technological advances such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, social media, and geographic information systems represent a building block of the digital transformation that supports the resilience of the food supply chain (FSC) and increases its efficiency. This paper reviews the literature surrounding digitalization in FSCs. A bibliometric and key-route main path analysis was carried out to objectively and analytically uncover the knowledge development in digitalization within the context of sustainable FSCs. The research began with the selection of 2140 articles published over nearly five decades. Then, the articles were examined according to several bibliometric metrics such as year of publication, countries, institutions, sources, authors, and keywords frequency. A keyword co-occurrence network was generated to cluster the relevant literature. Findings of the review and bibliometric analysis indicate that research at the intersection of technology and the FSC has gained substantial interest from scholars. On the basis of keyword co-occurrence network, the literature is focused on the role of information communication technology for agriculture and food security, food waste and circular economy, and the merge of the Internet of Things and blockchain in the FSC. The analysis of the key-route main path uncovers three critical periods marking the development of technology-enabled FSCs. The study offers scholars a better understanding of digitalization within the agri-food industry and the current knowledge gaps for future research. Practitioners may find the review useful to remain ahead of the latest discussions of technologyenabled FSCs. To the authors’ best knowledge, the current study is one of the few endeavors to explore technology-enabled FSCs using a comprehensive sample of journal articles published during the past five decades. © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - The SPIRIT 2013 (The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting, by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there is a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI. Both guidelines were developed using a staged consensus process, involving a literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted on by an international multi-stakeholder group in a 2-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed on in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items, which were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations around the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer-reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial. ©

N2  - The discussion in recent years about the sustainability of the mining industry has emphasized its commitment to social responsibility as an emerging topic. In this context, this article aims to develop a mapping of the literature on social responsibility in the mining industry. In accordance, a systematic literature review approach was adopted and, grounded on a rigorous screening processes, 72 significant papers were selected for analysis from the ISI Web of Knowledge database. The paper provides a bibliometric analysis regarding this specific field and, based on a content analysis approach, highlights a growing interest by the academic community and identifies two key research streams: i) Relationships with local communities, and ii) CSR reporting. Cluster 1 shows that relationships with stakeholders are important to mining companies in obtaining relevant social performance, and in acquiring local legitimacy from surrounding communities; cluster 2 highlights the importance of the elaboration, dissemination and quality of social reports, particularly concerning credibility. The review also points to shortcomings identified in literature, which correspond to potential significant opportunities for future research, either quantitative, qualitative, action research or mixed in nature. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

To assess the current value of restoration reviews, we examined a sample of meta-analyses and narrative syntheses (n = 91) with the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Synthesis Assessment Tool (CEESAT), which uses detailed criteria to assesses the method of policy-relevant evidence synthesis according to elements important for objectivity, transparency, and comprehensiveness. Overall, reviews scored low based on this standard: median score 16 out of 39, modal score 15, and mean 16.6. Meta-analyses scored higher than narrative syntheses (median 17 vs. 5, respectively), although there were some outlier narrative syntheses that had high scores, suggesting that quantitative synthesis does not solely reflect the reliability of a review. In general, criteria spanning the more fundamental review stages (i.e., searching for studies and including studies) received low scores for both synthesis types. Conversely, criteria comprising the later stages of the review (i.e., critical appraisal, data extraction, and data synthesis) were generally well described in meta-analyses; thus, these criteria achieved the highest individual CEESAT scores. We argue that restoration ecology is well positioned to advance so-called evidence-based restoration, but review authors should elucidate their conceptual understanding of evidence syntheses and recognize that conducting reliable reviews demands the same methodological rigor and reporting standards used in primary research. Given the potential of evidence reviews to inform management, policy, and research, it is of vital importance that the overall methodological reliability of restoration reviews be improved. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology

N2  - This paper provides an overview of the evolution and state-of-the-art of the Operations Research and Management Science (OR/MS) subject area from 1956 to 2019. Using text mining techniques on the content of the title, abstract, and author keywords of papers classified by the Web of Science as literature review studies in OR/MS, we found that there are 76 topical consolidated clusters in the field covering a wide range of reviewed topics. Since 2015, reviews on supply chain risk management and big data analytics have had the highest impact in the field, whereas topics such as Industry 4.0, socio-technical systems, social networks, green supply, sustainable supply chain, and resilience engineering have all received significant attention from researchers. Reviews on analytic hierarchy process were found to be the most impactful overall, showing the high relevance of multi-criteria decision making in the current research and practice contexts. Furthermore, a text mining analysis of the papers citing OR/MS literature reviews showed that optimization continues to be one of the most highly influential methodological contributions of OR/MS to other research areas and that topics such as circular economy, carbon emissions, and social commerce have yet to find some traction in OR/MS research, suggesting future research and multidisciplinary opportunities for the field. Results also show that the research area of Public Administration has been greatly influenced by OR/MS reviews as 16% of all the papers published in that field have cited at least one of the 1744 review papers included in this study. Finally, a summary table of published structured literature reviews per topic (benchmarks, classifications, taxonomies) is presented as a short bibliography of OR/MS review papers. © 2020

N2  - Background. Search and selection of primary studies in Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) is labour intensive, and hard to replicate and update. Aims. We explore a machine learning approach to support semi-automated search and selection in SLRs to address these weaknesses. Method. We 1) train a classifier on an initial set of papers, 2) extend this set of papers by automated search and snowballing, 3) have the researcher validate the top paper, selected by the classifier, and 4) update the set of papers and iterate the process until a stopping criterion is met. Results. We demonstrate with a proof-of-concept tool that the proposed automated search and selection approach generates valid search strings and that the performance for subsets of primary studies can reduce the manual work by half. Conclusions. The approach is promising and the demonstrated advantages include cost savings and replicability. The next steps include further tool development and evaluate the approach on a complete SLR. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

PD  - 
N2  - Longitudinal observational and randomized controlled trials (RCT) are widely applied in biomedical behavioral studies and increasingly implemented in smart health systems. These trials frequently produce data that are high-dimensional, correlated, and contain missing values, posing significant analytic challenges. Notably, visual analytics are underdeveloped in this area. In this paper, we developed a longitudinal topic model to implement the systematic review of visual analytic methods presented at the IEEE VIS conference over its 28 year history, in comparison with MIFuzzy, an integrated and comprehensive soft computing tool for behavioral trajectory pattern recognition, validation, and visualization of incomplete longitudinal data. The findings of our longitudinal topic modeling highlight the trend patterns of visual analytics development in longitudinal behavioral trials and underscore the gigantic gap of existing robust visual analytic methods and actual working algorithms for longitudinal behavioral trial data. Future research areas for visual analytics in behavioral trial studies and smart health systems are discussed. © 2020

N2  - Purpose: The objective of this paper is to assess and synthesize the published literature related to the application of data analytics, big data, data mining and machine learning to healthcare engineering systems. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to obtain the most relevant papers related to the research study from three different platforms: EBSCOhost, ProQuest and Scopus. The literature was assessed and synthesized, conducting analysis associated with the publications, authors and content. Findings: From the SLR, 576 publications were identified and analyzed. The research area seems to show the characteristics of a growing field with new research areas evolving and applications being explored. In addition, the main authors and collaboration groups publishing in this research area were identified throughout a social network analysis. This could lead new and current authors to identify researchers with common interests on the field. Research limitations/implications: The use of the SLR methodology does not guarantee that all relevant publications related to the research are covered and analyzed. However, the authors' previous knowledge and the nature of the publications were used to select different platforms. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper represents the most comprehensive literature-based study on the fields of data analytics, big data, data mining and machine learning applied to healthcare engineering systems. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - As digital libraries make the dissemination of research publications easier, they also enable the propagation of invalid or unreliable knowledge. Examples of relevant problems include: retraction and inadvertent citation and reuse of retracted papers [1], [2]; propagation of errors in literature and scientific databases [3], [4]; non-reproducible papers; known domain-specific issues such as cell line contamination [5]; bias in research datasets and publications [6]-[8]; systematic reviews that arrive at different conclusions about the same question at the same time [9], [10]. The digital environment facilitates broad interdisciplinary reuse beyond the originating scientific community; thus, marking known problems and tracing the impact on dependent and follow-on works is particularly important (but still under-addressed). Further, context-specific information inside a paper may not be immediately reusable when extracted by automated processes, leading to apparent contradictions [11]. Current mitigating approaches use the underlying reasoning for information retrieval [12], [13], develop new infrastructures analyzing the reasoning [14]-[16] or certainty [17] of statements, or use visualization to highlight possible discrepancies [10], [15]. © 2021 IEEE.

N2  - The number of scientific publications is increasing each year, specifically in the field of computer science. In order to condense existing knowledge, evidence-based software engineering is concerned with systematic literature reviews, surveys, and other kinds of literature analysis. These methods are used to summarize the evidence on empirical studies-or approaches in general- A nd to identify gaps for new research opportunities. However, executing systematic review processes requires a considerable amount of time and effort. Consequently, researchers have proposed several semi-automated approaches to support and facilitate different steps of such methods. With our current research, we aim to assist researchers to efficiently and effectively execute different steps, namely the search for and selection of primary studies. In this paper, we report several issues we identified during our research that threaten any kind of literature analysis and hamper suitable tool support. We further recommend solutions to mitigate these threats. Overall, our goal is to raise researchers' and publishers' awareness regarding several potential threats on literature analysis, to support software engineers in designing suitable tools for research, and to encourage the research community to solve these threats. © 2018 ACM.

N2  - With the ever increasing number of filed patent applications every year, the need for effective and efficient systems for managing such tremendous amounts of data becomes inevitably important. Patent retrieval (PR) is considered the pillar of almost all patent analysis tasks. PR is a subfield of information retrieval (IR) which is concerned with developing techniques and methods that effectively and efficiently retrieve relevant patent documents in response to a given search request. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on PR methods and approaches. It is clear that recent successes and maturity in IR applications such as Web search cannot be transferred directly to PR without deliberate domain adaptation and customization. Furthermore, state-of-the-art performance in automatic PR is still around average in terms of recall. These observations motivate the need for interactive search tools which provide cognitive assistance to patent professionals with minimal effort. These tools must also be developed in hand with patent professionals considering their practices and expectations. We additionally touch on related tasks to PR such as patent valuation, litigation, licensing, and highlight potential opportunities and open directions for computational scientists in these domains. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: Meta-research studies investigating methods, systems, and processes designed to improve the efficiency of systematic review workflows can contribute to building an evidence base that can help to increase value and reduce waste in research. This study demonstrates the use of an economic evaluation framework to compare the costs and effects of four variant approaches to identifying eligible studies for consideration in systematic reviews. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a basic decision-analytic model, to compare the relative efficiency of 'safety first', 'double screening', 'single screening' and 'single screening with text mining' approaches in the title-abstract screening stage of a 'case study' systematic review about undergraduate medical education in UK general practice settings. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the 'incremental cost per citation 'saved' from inappropriate exclusion' from the review. Resource use and effect parameters were estimated based on retrospective analysis of 'review process' meta-data curated alongside the 'case study' review, in conjunction with retrospective simulation studies to model the integrated use of text mining. Unit cost parameters were estimated based on the 'case study' review's project budget. A base case analysis was conducted, with deterministic sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of variations in values of key parameters. Results: Use of 'single screening with text mining' would have resulted in title-abstract screening workload reductions (base case analysis) of >60% compared with other approaches. Across modelled scenarios, the 'safety first' approach was, consistently, equally effective and less costly than conventional 'double screening'. Compared with 'single screening with text mining', estimated ICERs for the two non-dominated approaches (base case analyses) ranged from £1975 ('single screening' without a 'provisionally included' code) to £4427 ('safety first' with a 'provisionally included' code) per citation 'saved'. Patterns of results were consistent between base case and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Alternatives to the conventional 'double screening' approach, integrating text mining, warrant further consideration as potentially more efficient approaches to identifying eligible studies for systematic reviews. Comparable economic evaluations conducted using other systematic review datasets are needed to determine the generalisability of these findings and to build an evidence base to inform guidance for review authors. © 2016 Khan et al.

N2  - Context: Systematic literature reviews and mapping studies usually rely on automated searches of digital libraries to identify primary studies. Defining proper search strings, executing semantically similar searches on different libraries, and reporting limitations of searches increase the reliability of secondary studies. Objective: We aim to survey the current state of using automated searches in secondary software engineering studies. In particular, we aim at analyzing how automated searches are reported and at understanding the reproducibility of secondary studies. Method: We perform a preliminary tertiary study that covers 50 recently published representative secondary studies from different software engineering venues and subfields. Results: We found that most secondary studies complement an automated search with a manual search and use four or more digital libraries. Also, we found that the quality of reporting search strings is rather poor. Finally, we found that most secondary studies do not acknowledge limitations of automated searches and implications of limitations on study findings. Conclusions: Our findings highlight implications for researchers (e.g., to properly report the search process) and for reviewers (e.g., to execute search strings reported in papers). Also, our findings indicate that secondary studies are difficult to replicate. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - Search phase is considered as one of the most important steps in conducting secondary studies such as systematic literature reviews and mapping studies. In recent times, automatic search in digital libraries and academic search engines has been the preferred method of search phase execution for most software engineering related secondary studies. However, there are no previous studies that report or evaluate the secondary study relevant search features of these electronic data sources. We perform a feature analysis (screening mode) based evaluation of five widely used digital libraries (IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect and Wiley) in terms of their respective features required to support the search phase of secondary studies. We identify a total of 68 search related features and conduct a comprehensive exploration into their execution behaviors. The overall work presents a useful caution guide for systematic reviewers who plan to use the identified features for executing various search phase steps of their secondary studies.1 © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - A number of algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence offer poorly interpretable decisions. To disclose the reasoning behind such algorithms, their output can be explained by means of so-called evidence-based (or factual) explanations. Alternatively, contrastive and counterfactual explanations justify why the output of the algorithms is not any different and how it could be changed, respectively. It is of crucial importance to bridge the gap between theoretical approaches to contrastive and counterfactual explanation and the corresponding computational frameworks. In this work we conduct a systematic literature review which provides readers with a thorough and reproducible analysis of the interdisciplinary research field under study. We first examine theoretical foundations of contrastive and counterfactual accounts of explanation. Then, we report the state-of-the-art computational frameworks for contrastive and counterfactual explanation generation. In addition, we analyze how grounded such frameworks are on the insights from the inspected theoretical approaches. As a result, we highlight a variety of properties of the approaches under study and reveal a number of shortcomings thereof. Moreover, we define a taxonomy regarding both theoretical and practical approaches to contrastive and counterfactual explanation. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Background: Demographic and sociobehavioral factors are strong drivers of HIV infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa. These factors are often studied in qualitative research but ignored in quantitative analyses. However, they provide in-depth insight into the local behavior and may help to improve HIV prevention. Objective: To obtain a comprehensive overview of the sociobehavioral factors influencing HIV prevalence and incidence in Malawi, we systematically reviewed the literature using a newly programmed tool for automatizing part of the systematic review process. Methods: Due to the choice of broad search terms ("HIV AND Malawi"), our preliminary search revealed many thousands of articles. We, therefore, developed a Python tool to automatically extract, process, and categorize open-access articles published from January 1, 1987 to October 1, 2019 in the PubMed, PubMed Central, JSTOR, Paperity, and arXiV databases. We then used a topic modelling algorithm to classify and identify publications of interest. Results: Our tool extracted 22,709 unique articles; 16,942 could be further processed. After topic modelling, 519 of these were clustered into relevant topics, of which 20 were kept after manual screening. We retrieved 7 more publications after examining the references so that 27 publications were finally included in the review. Reducing the 16,942 articles to 519 potentially relevant articles using the software took 5 days. Several factors contributing to the risk of HIV infection were identified, including religion, gender and relationship dynamics, beliefs, and sociobehavioral attitudes. Conclusions: Our software does not replace traditional systematic reviews, but it returns useful results to broad queries of open-access literature in under a week, without a priori knowledge. This produces a "seed dataset" of relevance that could be further developed. It identified known factors and factors that may be specific to Malawi. In the future, we aim to expand the tool by adding more social science databases and applying it to other sub-Saharan African countries. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

N2  - Purpose: This study aims to provide a systematic literature review of the research study in the area of limit order book (LOB) mechanism of trading and its implications for market efficiency. The study attempts to document the recent theoretical developments and empirical findings from the literature exhaustively and identifies the research gaps for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses seven reputable databases to select 2,514 research studies spanning over 1981-2018 (finally compressed to a pool of 103 articles, based on relevance and impact). The study uses bibliometric network visualization and text analytics to categorize and examine the literature. The chosen articles are compiled and analyzed to provide a comprehensive account of the current research on LOBs. Findings: The recent LOB literature is summarized on various criteria as follows: sub-areas, the types of economies and markets, methodologies and the LOB measures. The review identifies a dearth of studies on the LOBs in emerging markets. It suggests the potential research areas as intraday studies in emerging LOB markets; application of market indicators based on deeper levels of LOB, beyond the best prices; market fragmentation, order routing decision and its impact on order execution quality; optimal display of LOB levels; liquidity dynamics in quote-driven markets vis-à-vis LOB markets; effect of high-frequency trading on market microstructure; application of advanced techniques (e.g. machine learning models, zero-intelligent models); relationship between the trading speed, order aggressiveness, shape and resilience of the order book and informed trading; and information content of the auxiliary order submission strategies, including cancellation, amendments and hidden orders. Originality/value: For the past 15 years, to the best of the knowledge, a comprehensive review of the literature on LOBs has not been published. The financial markets have transformed significantly over this period, driven by the adoption of LOBs, low latency trading and technological advancements in information dissemination. This article provides an extensive collection and classification of the literature on LOBs. This would be useful for the practitioners, future researchers and academics in the area of financial markets. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Healthcare consumers, researchers, patients and policy makers increasingly use systematic reviews (SRs) to aid their decision-making process. However, the conduct of SRs can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive task. Often, clinical practice guideline developers or other decision-makers need to make informed decisions in a timely fashion (e.g. outbreaks of infection, hospital-based health technology assessments). Possible approaches to address the issue of timeliness in the production of SRs are to (a) implement process parallelisation, (b) adapt and apply innovative technologies, and/or (c) modify SR processes (e.g. study eligibility criteria, search sources, data extraction or quality assessment). Highly parallelised systematic reviewing requires substantial resources to support a team of experienced information specialists, reviewers and methodologists working alongside with clinical content experts to minimise the time for completing individual review steps while maximising the parallel progression of multiple steps. Effective coordination and management within the team and across external stakeholders are essential elements of this process. Emerging innovative technologies have a great potential for reducing workload and improving efficiency of SR production. The most promising areas of application would be to allow automation of specific SR tasks, in particular if these tasks are time consuming and resource intensive (e.g. language translation, study selection, data extraction). Modification of SR processes involves restricting, truncating and/or bypassing one or more SR steps, which may risk introducing bias to the review findings. Although the growing experiences in producing various types of rapid reviews (RR) and the accumulation of empirical studies exploring potential bias associated with specific SR tasks have contributed to the methodological development for expediting SR production, there is still a dearth of research examining the actual impact of methodological modifications and comparing the findings between RRs and SRs. This evidence would help to inform as to which SR tasks can be accelerated or truncated and to what degree, while maintaining the validity of review findings. Timely delivered SRs can be of value in informing healthcare decisions and recommendations, especially when there is practical urgency and there is no other relevant synthesised evidence. © 2015 Tsertsvadze et al.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this work is to increase awareness of the potential of the technique of text mining to discover knowledge and further promote research collaboration between knowledge management and the information technology communities. Since its emergence, text mining has involved multidisciplinary studies, focused primarily on database technology, Web-based collaborative writing, text analysis, machine learning and knowledge discovery. However, owing to the large amount of research in this field, it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify existing studies and therefore suggest new topics. Design/methodology/approach: This article offers a systematic review of 85 academic outputs (articles and books) focused on knowledge discovery derived from the text mining technique. The systematic review is conducted by applying “text mining at the term level, in which knowledge discovery takes place on a more focused collection of words and phrases that are extracted from and label each document” (Feldman et al., 1998, p. 1). Findings: The results revealed that the keywords extracted to be associated with the main labels, id est, knowledge discovery and text mining, can be categorized in two periods: from 1998 to 2009, the term knowledge and text were always used. From 2010 to 2017 in addition to these terms, sentiment analysis, review manipulation, microblogging data and knowledgeable users were the other terms frequently used. Besides this, it is possible to notice the technical, engineering nature of each term present in the first decade. Whereas, a diverse range of fields such as business, marketing and finance emerged from 2010 to 2017 owing to a greater interest in the online environment. Originality/value: This is a first comprehensive systematic review on knowledge discovery and text mining through the use of a text mining technique at term level, which offers to reduce redundant research and to avoid the possibility of missing relevant publications. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Background: Systematic literature studies (SLS) have become a core research methodology in Evidence-based Software Engineering (EBSE). Search completeness, i.e., finding all relevant papers on the topic of interest, has been recognized as one of the most commonly discussed validity issues of SLSs. Aim: This study aims at raising awareness on the issues related to search string construction and on search validation using a quasi-gold standard (QGS). Furthermore, we aim at providing guidelines for search string validation. Method: We use a recently completed tertiary study as a case and complement our findings with the observations from other researchers studying and advancing EBSE. Results: We found that the issue of assessing QGS quality has not seen much attention in the literature, and the validation of automated searches in SLSs could be improved. Hence, we propose to extend the current search validation approach by the additional analysis step of the automated search validation results and provide recommendations for the QGS construction. Conclusion: In this paper, we report on new issues which could affect search completeness in SLSs. Furthermore, the proposed guideline and recommendations could help researchers implement a more reliable search strategy in their SLSs. © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - This research-on-research study describes efforts to develop non-Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs) by analyzing demographical and time-course collaborations between international institutions using protocols registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) or published in scientific journals. We have published an a priori protocol to develop this study. Protocols published in scientific journals were searched using the MEDLINE and Embase databases; the query terms “Systematic review” [Title] AND “protocol” [Title] were searched from February 2011 to December 2017. Protocols registered at PROSPERO during the same period were obtained by web scraping all non-Cochrane records with a Python script. After excluding protocols that had a fulfillment or duplication rate of less than 90%, they were classified as published “only in PROSPERO”, “only in journals”, or in “journals and PROSPERO”. Results of data and metadata extraction using text mining processes were curated by two reviewers. These Datasets and R scripts are freely available to facilitate reproducibility. We obtained 20,814 protocols of non-Cochrane SRs. While “unique protocols” by reviewers’ institutions from 60 countries were the most frequent, a median of 6 (2-150) institutions from 130 different countries were involved in the preparation of “collaborative protocols”. The highest Ranked countries involved in overall protocol production were the UK, the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. Most protocols were registered only in PROSPERO. However, the number of protocols published in scientific journals (924) or in both PROSPERO and journals (807) has increased over the last three years. Syst Rev and BMJ Open published more than half of the total protocols. While the more productive countries were involved in “unique” and “collaborative protocols”, less productive countries only participated in “collaborative protocols” that were mainly published in PROSPERO. Our results suggest that, although most countries were involved in solitary production of protocols for non-Cochrane SRs during the study period, it would be useful to develop new strategies to promote international collaborations, especially with less productive countries. © 2019 Viguera-Guerra et al.

N2  - This paper presents a systematic literature review that reflects the current state of research in the field of algorithms and models for map generalization, the existing solutions for automatic (tactile) map generation, as well as good practices for designing spatial databases for the purposes of automatic map development. A total number of over 500 primary studies were screened in order to identify the most relevant research on automatic (tactile) map generation from the last decade. The reviewed papers revealed many existing solutions in the field of automatic map production, as well as algorithms (e.g., Douglas–Peucker, Visvalingam–Whyatt) and models (e.g., GAEL, CartACom) for data generalization that might be used to transform traditional spatial data into the haptic form, suitable for blind and visually impaired people. However, it turns out that a comprehensive solution for automatic tactile map generation does not exist. © 2019 by the authors.

N2  - Systematic reviews underpin Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) by addressing precise clinical questions via comprehensive synthesis of all relevant published evidence. Authors of systematic reviews typically define a Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (a PICO criteria) of interest, and then retrieve, appraise and synthesize results from all reports of clinical trials that meet these criteria. Identifying PICO elements in the full-texts of trial reports is thus a critical yet time-consuming step in the systematic review process. We seek to expedite evidence synthesis by developing machine learning models to automatically extract sentences from articles relevant to PICO elements. Collecting a large corpus of training data for this task would be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we derive distant supervision (DS) with which to train models using previously conducted reviews. DS entails heuristically deriving 'soft' labels from an available structured resource. However, we have access only to unstructured, free-text summaries of PICO elements for corresponding articles; we must derive from these the desired sentence-level annotations. To this end, we propose a novel method - supervised distant supervision (SDS) - that uses a small amount of direct supervision to better exploit a large corpus of distantly labeled instances by learning to pseudo-annotate articles using the available DS. We show that this approach tends to outperform existing methods with respect to automated PICO extraction. ©2016 Byron C. Wallace, Joel Kuiper, Aakash Sharma, Mingxi Zhu and Iain J. Marshall.

N2  - In the construction area, visuals such as drawings, photos, videos, and 3D models, play a significant role in the design, build and maintenance of a facility, bringing efficiency to generate, transfer, and store information. Advanced visual computing techniques facilitate the understanding of design contents, work plans, and other types of information shared in the construction industry. Automatic visual data collection and analysis provide many possibilities to the construction industry and a large number of works have investigated how visual computing can improve construction management processes and other problems in the construction area. However, a comprehensive literature review is needed. This study uses bibliometric approaches to review the works published to date, and analyses the development of knowledge, significant research results, and trends. The purpose of this study is to help newcomers to this research field understand knowledge structure and formulate research directions, thereby enhancing knowledge development. From this study, it can be concluded that computer vision is a key axis of improvement. Moreover, building information modeling, laser scanning, and other visualization-related techniques are also important in advancing the construction area. © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - High-quality medical systematic reviews require comprehensive literature searches to ensure the recommendations and outcomes are sufficiently reliable. Indeed, searching for relevant medical literature is a key phase in constructing systematic reviews and often involves domain (medical researchers) and search (information specialists) experts in developing the search queries. Queries in this context are highly complex, based on Boolean logic, include free-text terms and index terms from standardised terminologies (e.g., MeSH), and are difficult and time-consuming to build. The use of MeSH terms, in particular, has been shown to improve the quality of the search results. However, identifying the correct MeSH terms to include in a query is difficult: information experts are often unfamiliar with the MeSH database and unsure about the appropriateness of MeSH terms for a query. Naturally, the full value of the MeSH terminology is often not fully exploited. This paper investigates methods to suggest MeSH terms based on an initial Boolean query that includes only free-text terms. These methods promise to automatically identify highly effective MeSH terms for inclusion in a systematic review query. Our study contributes an empirical evaluation of several MeSH term suggestion methods. We perform an extensive analysis of the retrieval, ranking, and refinement of MeSH term suggestions for each method and how these suggestions impact the effectiveness of Boolean queries. © 2021 ACM.

When testing any of these approaches, the criterion standard of comparison (gold standard) is usually human reviewers. Yet, human reviewers make errors in inclusion and exclusion of references. Objectives To determine citation false inclusion and false exclusion rates during abstract screening by pairs of independent reviewers. These rates can help in designing, testing and implementing automated approaches. Methods We identified all systematic reviews conducted between 2010 and 2017 by an evidence-based practice center in the United States. Eligible reviews had to follow standard systematic review procedures with dual independent screening of abstracts and full texts, in which citation inclusion by one reviewer prompted automatic inclusion through the next level of screening. Disagreements between reviewers during full text screening were reconciled via consensus or arbitration by a third reviewer. A false inclusion or exclusion was defined as a decision made by a single reviewer that was inconsistent with the final included list of studies. Results We analyzed a total of 139,467 citations that underwent 329,332 inclusion and exclusion decisions from 86 unique reviewers. The final systematic reviews included 5.48% of the potential references identified through bibliographic database search (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.38% to 8.58%). After abstract screening, the total error rate (false inclusion and false exclusion) was 10.76% (95% CI: 7.43% to 14.09%). Conclusions This study suggests important false inclusion and exclusion rates by human reviewers. When deciding the validity of a future automated study selection algorithm, it is important to keep in mind that the gold standard is not perfect and that achieving error rates similar to humans may be adequate and can save resources and time. © 2020 Wang et al.

N2  - This paper is about mapping innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the help of patents. It leverages the use of Social Data Science techniques on two levels: (1) we perform a content analysis of all the abstracts of the available patents of an extensive database; (2) we use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique on these patents' abstracts to extract which categories best describe each subfield of AI. Our goal is to have a deeper perspective and a deeper understanding of the various developments in AI through time and geography. The database used in this paper is one of the most comprehensive, with a total of 55,109 patents. To contextualize this study, the literature review uses information from 29,225 articles. In both cases, the analysis of such amount of information could not be possible without dedicated computing power. © 2017 IEEE.

N2  - As quality of life (QoL) is a highly interdisciplinary topic with a multitude of related research areas, it is beneficial to avail researchers of an overview of the different streams explored in the field. Furthermore, knowledge of prominent sub-domains helps researchers identify links and overlaps between QoL and their fields of interest. To meet these needs, a text-mining-based computational literature review (CLR) of the journal of Applied Research in Quality of Life (ARQOL) was conducted using a machine learning process, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), in combination with selection criteria for the decision on the number of topics. The outcome provides the reader with a list of the twelve most heavily discussed topics: 1) consumption & materialism, 2) character strength, 3) spirituality, religiousness & personal beliefs, 4) inequality, 5) leisure & tourism, 6) health related QoL (HRQoL) I, 7) quality of working life (QWL), 8) childhood & adolescence, 9) disparity & development, 10) disorder, 11) community issues, and 12) health related QoL (HRQoL) II. In addition, authors, titles, and publication dates are listed for the top-5-ranked papers that most typify these topics. Subsequent content summaries of these papers reveal more detailed information, such as measurement constructs and theories. © 2021, The International Society for Quality-of-Life Studies (ISQOLS) and Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - revtools: An R package to support article screening for evidence synthesis
AU  - Westgate, M. J.

PD  - 
N2  - The field of evidence synthesis is growing rapidly, with a corresponding increase in the number of software tools and workflows to support the construction of systematic reviews, systematic maps, and meta-analyses. Despite much progress, however, a number of problems remain, including slow integration of new statistical or methodological approaches into user-friendly software, low prevalence of open-source software, and poor integration among distinct software tools. These issues hinder the utility and transparency of new methods to the research community. Here, I present revtools, an R package to support article screening during evidence synthesis projects. It provides tools for the import and deduplication of bibliographic data, screening of articles by title or abstract, and visualization of article content using topic models. The software is entirely open-source and combines command-line scripting for experienced programmers with custom-built user interfaces for casual users, with further methods to support article screening to be added over time. revtools provides free access to novel methods in an open-source environment and represents a valuable step in expanding the capacity of R to support evidence synthesis projects. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although the implementation of systematic review and evidence mapping methods stands to improve the transparency and accuracy of chemical assessments, they also accentuate the challenges that assessors face in ensuring they have located and included all the evidence that is relevant to evaluating the potential health effects an exposure might be causing. This challenge of information retrieval can be characterized in terms of “semantic” and “conceptual” factors that render chemical assessments vulnerable to the streetlight effect. OBJECTIVES: This commentary presents how controlled vocabularies, thesauruses, and ontologies contribute to overcoming the streetlight effect in information retrieval, making up the key components of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs) that enable more systematic access to assessment-relevant information than is currently achievable. The concept of Adverse Outcome Pathways is used to illustrate what a general KOS for use in chemical assessment could look like. DISCUSSION: Ontologies are an underexploited element of effective knowledge organization in the environmental health sciences. Agreeing on and implementing ontologies in chemical assessment is a complex but tractable process with four fundamental steps. Successful implementation of ontolo-gies would not only make currently fragmented information about health risks from chemical exposures vastly more accessible, it could ultimately enable computational methods for chemical assessment that can take advantage of the full richness of data described in natural language in primary studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6994. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

N2  - As a revolutionary technology, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is attracting increasing interest in the fields of architecture, engineering and construction (AEC), with outstanding advantages, such as highly automated, non‐contact operation and efficient large‐scale sampling capability. TLS has extended a new approach to capturing extremely comprehensive data of the construction environment, providing detailed information for further analysis. This paper presents a systematic review based on scientometric and qualitative analysis to summarize the progress and the current status of the topic and to point out promising research efforts. To begin with, a brief understanding of TLS is provided. Following the selection of relevant papers through a literature search, a scientometric analysis of papers is carried out. Then, major applications are categorized and presented, including (1) 3D model reconstruction, (2) object recognition, (3) deformation measurement, (4) quality assessment, and (5) progress tracking. For widespread adoption and effective use of TLS, essential problems impacting working effects in application are summarized as follows: workflow, data quality, scan planning, and data processing. Finally, future research directions are suggested, including: (1) cost control of hardware and software, (2) improvement of data processing capability, (3) automatic scan planning, (4) integration of digital technologies, (5) adoption of artificial intelligence. © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - An extended drought period with low precipitation can result in low water availability and issues for humans, animals, and plants. Drought forecasting is critical for water resource development and management as it helps to reduce negative consequences. In this study, scientometric analysis and manual comprehensive analysis on drought modelling and forecasting are used. A scientometric analysis is used to determine the current research trend using bibliometric data and to identify relevant publication field sources with the most publications, the most frequently used keywords, the most cited articles and authors, and the countries that have made the greatest contributions to the field of water resources. This paper also tries to provide an overview of water issues, such as drought classification, drought indices, historical droughts, and their impact on Asian countries such as China, Pakistan, India, and Iran. There have been many models established for this purpose and choosing the appropriate model for study is a long procedure for researchers. An appropriate, comprehensive, pedagogical study of model ideas and historical implementations would benefit researchers by helping them to avoid overlooking viable model options, thus reducing their time spent on the topic. As a result, the goal of this paper is to review drought-forecasting approaches and recommend the best models for the Asian region. The models are divided into four categories based on their mechanisms: Regression analysis, stochastic modelling, machine learning, and dynamic modelling. The basic concepts of each approach in terms of the model’s historical use, benefits, and limitations are explained. Finally, prospects for future drought research in Asia are discussed as well as potential modelling techniques. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Smart contracts have been well-received by researchers and practitioners for the unique features of automatic execution, transparency, and nontampering in a blockchain environment. However, little is known about the current development status of knowledge and practice regarding the application of smart contracts in various industries, especially from the procurement perspective. Thus, this paper aims to address the gap with a mixed method of bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review. Based on the evaluation of 174 filtered publications, the review has analyzed the current development status of this research area with its distributions in years and journals, cooperation networks between authors, institutions, and countries, keywords cooccurrence network, and classifications of the application of smart contracts. The results show the application of smart contracts has attracted global attention since 2016 with the Ethereum and Hyperledger fabric as the main platforms in various industries, especially in information communication technology (ICT), public management, supply chain, energy, finance, and healthcare. Various functions and benefits of smart contracts, as well as their potential advantages, have been identified and articulated from the procurement perspective. A research framework has also been developed to highlight future procurement needs in business operations across the industries via an integrated procurement approach of smart contracts. © 2021 Yongshun Xu et al.

N2  - Background: Performing systematic reviews is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Objective: We investigated whether a machine learning system could perform systematic reviews more efficiently. Methods: All systematic reviews and meta-analyses of interventional randomized controlled trials cited in recent clinical guidelines from the American Diabetes Association, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association (2 guidelines), and American Stroke Association were assessed. After reproducing the primary screening data set according to the published search strategy of each, we extracted correct articles (those actually reviewed) and incorrect articles (those not reviewed) from the data set. These 2 sets of articles were used to train a neural network–based artificial intelligence engine (Concept Encoder, Fronteo Inc). The primary endpoint was work saved over sampling at 95% recall (WSS@95%). Results: Among 145 candidate reviews of randomized controlled trials, 8 reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For these 8 reviews, the machine learning system significantly reduced the literature screening workload by at least 6-fold versus that of manual screening based on WSS@95%. When machine learning was initiated using 2 correct articles that were randomly selected by a researcher, a 10-fold reduction in workload was achieved versus that of manual screening based on the WSS@95% value, with high sensitivity for eligible studies. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased dramatically every time the algorithm learned a correct article. Conclusions: Concept Encoder achieved a 10-fold reduction of the screening workload for systematic review after learning from 2 randomly selected studies on the target topic. However, few meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were included. Concept Encoder could facilitate the acquisition of evidence for clinical guidelines. © Tomohide Yamada, Daisuke Yoneoka, Yuta Hiraike, Kimihiro Hino, Hiroyoshi Toyoshiba, Akira Shishido, Hisashi Noma, Nobuhiro Shojima, Toshimasa Yamauchi.

The search methods used in systematic reviews provide the foundation for establishing the body of literature from which conclusions are drawn and recommendations made. Searches should be comprehensive and reporting of search methods should be transparent and reproducible. Campbell Collaboration systematic reviews strive to adhere to the best methodological guidance available for this type of searching. The current work aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the search methods and reporting in Campbell Collaboration systematic reviews. Our specific objectives include the following: To examine how searches are currently conducted in Campbell systematic reviews. To identify any machine learning or automation methods used, or emerging and less commonly used approaches to web searching. To examine how search strategies, search methods and search reporting adhere to the Methodological Expectations of Campbell Collaboration Intervention Reviews (MECCIR) and PRISMA guidelines. The findings will be used to identify opportunities for advancing current practices in Campbell reviews through updated guidance, peer review processes and author training and support. © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Machine learning (ML) and the latest deep learning (DL) algorithms have been widely used lately in remotely sensed data analysis. Urban management has also made such developments in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, but not with the same degree of commitment as another major, mainly because machine learning and deep learning are still considered to be complex and consuming in terms of material resources, and data. Nevertheless, ML and DL could be more effective, especially in the development of management strategies and new scenarios. In this paper, we present a literature review of selected studies, including a statistical review of 188 articles that applied ML and DL to remote sensing and urban applications between 1994 and 2020. This review represents practically a comprehensive coverage of applications and technologies in this field, from data preparation to results mapping. © 2020 ACM.

N2  - Context: Adaptive monitoring is a method used in a variety of domains for responding to changing conditions. It has been applied in different ways, from monitoring systems’ customization to re-composition, in different application domains. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies analyzing how adaptive monitoring differs or resembles among the existing approaches. Objective: To characterize the current state of the art on adaptive monitoring, specifically to: (a) identify the main concepts in the adaptive monitoring topic; (b) determine the demographic characteristics of the studies published in this topic; (c) identify how adaptive monitoring is conducted and evaluated by the different approaches; (d) identify patterns in the approaches supporting adaptive monitoring. Method: We have conducted a systematic mapping study of adaptive monitoring approaches following recommended practices. We have applied automatic search and snowballing sampling on different sources and used rigorous selection criteria to retrieve the final set of papers. Moreover, we have used an existing qualitative analysis method for extracting relevant data from studies. Finally, we have applied data mining techniques for identifying patterns in the solutions. Results: We have evaluated 110 studies organized in 81 approaches that support adaptive monitoring. By analyzing them, we have: (1) surveyed related terms and definitions of adaptive monitoring and proposed a generic one; (2) visualized studies’ demographic data and arranged the studies into approaches; (3) characterized the main approaches’ contributions; (4) determined how approaches conduct the adaptation process and evaluate their solutions. Conclusions: This cross-domain overview of the current state of the art on adaptive monitoring may be a solid and comprehensive baseline for researchers and practitioners in the field. Especially, it may help in identifying opportunities of research; for instance, the need of proposing generic and flexible software engineering solutions for supporting adaptive monitoring in a variety of systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Landscape scientists have increasingly studied sustainability during the past three decades, with a plurality of perspectives and methods. However, a comprehensive review of the relevant literature is still lacking. Two concepts capture the core of these studies: sustainable landscapes (SL) and landscape sustainability (LS). Here we present a bibliometric analysis of 333 English papers published in SCI journals (i.e., indexed by Web of Science) during 1990–2017, whose titles, abstracts or keywords contain SL, LS, or both. Using multiple methods, including change-point detection, text and topic mining, and citation analysis, we found: (1) Sustainability studies of landscapes have entered a rapid growth phase since 2004–2006, as determined statistically by the annual publications and citations; (2) There have been many more studies focusing on the ecological and practical dimensions than sociocultural and theoretical dimensions; and (3) Influenced by advances in sustainability research in a broader science context, studies of SL and LS have become increasingly holistic, transdisciplinary, and normative. Our findings suggest that, to further advance landscape sustainability science, scholars need to be more explicit about the underlying sustainability perspective and associated scales of key terms (e.g., SL, LS, and ecosystem services) in specific studies, and need to put more emphasis on place-based case studies of various landscape unsustainability syndromes by integrating the sustainability science-based social-ecological systems and transdisciplinary perspectives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Green supply chain (GSC), one of the most vital sub-topics of sustainable development, indicates people provoking on the rationality of business practices and resource consumption patterns. Under the background of economy globalization, developing countries, especially China, severely affected by green barriers became the global focus. A systematic review of articles about GSC which published in leading journals of Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) and China Knowledge Resource Infrastructure (CNKI) is proposed for exploring publishing trends, the distribution of authors and journals, research topics, and hotspots and predicting frontiers by utilizing VOSviewer, Sci2, and CiteSpace. The results show that (1) there are differences in the attention of GSC between international and Chinese academia. (2) “Green” is referred to environmental friendly practices in international academia. Scholars advocate to promote management to strengthen cooperation among GSC members and boost technology investment to improve the comprehensive performance; however, specific practices such as “low-carbon,” “emission reduction,” “recycling,” and “remanufacture” are referred to environmental friendly behaviors in Chinese academia. Scholars expect to avoid enterprises’ short-term profit compression relying on government subsidies and make contracts to share environment protection cost equally out for ensuring GSC stable operation. (3) Exploring collaboration among GSC members using complex operation research and artificial intelligence will be international research frontier. Relevant papers are to provide Chinese research with merely innovation in methodology. Besides, the “government-enterprise-university-research institute-customer-economy” management mode proposed by development countries like China will enrich the international GSC research scope, leading international GSC knowledge structure to change. The contribution of this study is to afford reference for future research on GSC. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Towards a Responsible Intelligent HCI for Journalism: A Systematic Review of Digital Journalism
AU  - Zhou, Y.

PD  - 
N2  - Previous research has been exploring the user experiences, interface design, and production processes of journalistic products, and it is important to continue such discussions on how better Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research and practices improve the production and consumption of news. Specifically, because of the development of Big Data and AI digital technologies, it is now vital to investigate how such technologies can be integrated into the HCI design for better user experience. With the aim to systematically examine digital journalism research fronts for better HCI, a scientometric study has been conducted by analyzing 2156 articles on digital journalism, collected from the Web of Science (WoS) database, so as to critically evaluate the extant literature investigating such relationship between HCI and digital journalism for future research directions. By analyzing major disciplines, core publications, keywords, and key authors’ ideas, this study found that the multidisciplinary knowledge surrounding digital journalism, especially top disciplines such as communication, computer science, information science & library science can be divided into four main categories: journalism and framing; interactivity; analytics and metrics; big data and transparency. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a better overall picture on the relationship between journalism and interaction design, thereby helping advancing both fields with preliminary but important findings. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - Background: Shortly after the emergence of COVID-19, researchers rapidly mobilized to study numerous aspects of the disease such as its evolution, clinical manifestations, effects, treatments, and vaccinations. This led to a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19-related publications. Identifying trends and areas of interest using traditional review methods (eg, scoping and systematic reviews) for such a large domain area is challenging. Objective: We aimed to conduct an extensive bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 literature. Methods: We used the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) that consists of a large number of research articles related to all coronaviruses. We used a machine learning-based method to analyze the most relevant COVID-19-related articles and extracted the most prominent topics. Specifically, we used a clustering algorithm to group published articles based on the similarity of their abstracts to identify research hotspots and current research directions. We have made our software accessible to the community via GitHub. Results: Of the 196,630 publications retrieved from the database, we included 28,904 in our analysis. The mean number of weekly publications was 990 (SD 789.3). The country that published the highest number of COVID-19-related articles was China (2950/17,270, 17.08%). The highest number of articles were published in bioRxiv. Lei Liu affiliated with the Southern University of Science and Technology in China published the highest number of articles (n=46). Based on titles and abstracts alone, we were able to identify 1515 surveys, 733 systematic reviews, 512 cohort studies, 480 meta-analyses, and 362 randomized control trials. We identified 19 different topics covered among the publications reviewed. The most dominant topic was public health response, followed by clinical care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical characteristics and risk factors, and epidemic models for its spread. Conclusions: We provide an overview of the COVID-19 literature and have identified current hotspots and research directions. Our findings can be useful for the research community to help prioritize research needs and recognize leading COVID-19 researchers, institutes, countries, and publishers. Our study shows that an AI-based bibliometric analysis has the potential to rapidly explore a large corpus of academic publications during a public health crisis. We believe that this work can be used to analyze other eHealth-related literature to help clinicians, administrators, and policy makers to obtain a holistic view of the literature and be able to categorize different topics of the existing research for further analyses. It can be further scaled (for instance, in time) to clinical summary documentation. Publishers should avoid noise in the data by developing a way to trace the evolution of individual publications and unique authors. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.

N2  - Society is facing many challenges, including, climate change, COVID, inequity and human population growth. Some researchers suggest that integration of Circular Economy (CE) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) concepts and approaches can help us to make progress towards sustainable societies. Integrated implementation can help to improve the design of product–service systems focused on prevention and reduction of wastage of materials, energy, human health, and ecosystems. The CE practices enable consumers to return products after use and to reuse the products with more value. Will integrated adoption of CE and I4.0 practices help society to be more sustainable? What is known about the climate change benefits of integration of I4.0 and CEs to reduce energy and resource usage? The authors sought to answer these questions, via a systematic bibliometric literature review, and network analysis of literature on I4.0 and CE for logistics and supply chain applications. The review was performed by searching the SCOPUS database for literature about I4.0 and CE. A total of 165 articles were shortlisted for in-depth review. The literature review was complimented by bibliometric and network analyses. The review provided insights into the present and future trends in integration of I4.0 and related Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in CE's. Based on the findings, a framework for integrating I4.0 and CE, was developed to guide CE decision-making that will help researchers and industrialists, integrate I4.0 tools within CEs to improve logistics, resource efficiency, safety, product quality and reduce fossil-carbon footprints. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Effective and early fault detection and diagnosis techniques have tremendously enhanced over the years to ensure continuous operations of contemporary complex systems, control cost, and enhance safety in assets-intensive industries, including oil and gas, process, and power generation. The objective of this work is to understand the development of different fault detection and diagnosis methods, their applications, and benefits to the industry. This paper presents a contemporary state-of-the-art systematic literature survey focusing on a comprehensive review of the models for fault detection and their industrial applications. This study uses advanced tools from bibliometric analysis to systematically analyze over 500 peer-reviewed articles on focus areas published since 2010. We first present an exploratory analysis and identify the influential contributions to the field, authors, and countries, among other key indicators. A network analysis is presented to unveil and visualize the clusters of the distinguishable areas using a co-citation network analysis. Later, a detailed content analysis of the top-100 most-cited papers is carried out to understand the progression of fault detection and artificial intelligence–based algorithms in different industrial applications. The findings of this paper allow us to comprehend the development of reliability-based fault analysis techniques over time, and the use of smart algorithms and their success. This work helps to make a unique contribution toward revealing the future avenues and setting up a prospective research road map for asset-intensive industry, researchers, and policymakers. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Reliability of search in systematic reviews: Towards a quality assessment framework for the automated-search strategy
AU  - Ali, N. B.
AU  - Usman, M.
PY  - 2018
PD  - 
N2  - Context: The trust in systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to provide credible recommendations is critical for establishing evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) practice. The reliability of SLR as a method is not a given and largely depends on the rigor of the attempt to identify, appraise and aggregate evidence. Previous research, by comparing SLRs on the same topic, has identified search as one of the reasons for discrepancies in the included primary studies. This affects the reliability of an SLR, as the papers identified and included in it are likely to influence its conclusions. Objective: We aim to propose a comprehensive evaluation checklist to assess the reliability of an automated-search strategy used in an SLR. Method: Using a literature review, we identified guidelines for designing and reporting automated-search as a primary search strategy. Using the aggregated design, reporting and evaluation guidelines, we formulated a comprehensive evaluation checklist. The value of this checklist was demonstrated by assessing the reliability of search in 27 recent SLRs. Results: Using the proposed evaluation checklist, several additional issues (not captured by the current evaluation checklist) related to the reliability of search in recent SLRs were identified. These issues severely limit the coverage of literature by the search and also the possibility to replicate it. Conclusion: Instead of solely relying on expensive replications to assess the reliability of SLRs, this work provides means to objectively assess the likely reliability of a search-strategy used in an SLR. It highlights the often-assumed aspect of repeatability of search when using automated-search. Furthermore, by explicitly considering repeatability and consistency as sub-characteristics of a reliable search, it provides a more comprehensive evaluation checklist than the ones currently used in EBSE. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AU  - Al-Imam, A.
PY  - 2019
PD  - 
N2  - Epidemiological sciences have been evolving at an exponential rate paralleled only by the comparable growth within the discipline of data science. Digital epidemiological studies are playing a vital role in medical science analytics for the past few decades. To date, there are no published attempts at deploying the use of real-time analytics in connection with the disciplines of dentistry. We implemented a real-time statistical analysis in connection with topics in Dental Anatomy and Dental Pathology represented by the maxillary sinus, posterior maxillary teeth, related oral pathology. The purpose is to infer the digital epidemiology based on a continuous stream of raw data retrieved from Google Trends database. Statistical analysis was carried out via Microsoft Excel 2016 and SPSS version 24. Google Trends database was used to retrieve data for digital epidemiology. Real-time analysis and the statistical inference were based on encoding a programming script using Python high-level programming language. A systematic review of the literature was carried out via PubMed-NCBI, the Cochrane Library, and Elsevier databases. The comprehensive analysis of databases of the literature, based on specific keywords search, yielded 491813 published studies. These were distributed as 488,884 (PubMed-NCBI), 1611 (the Cochrane Library), and 1318 (Elsevier). However, there was no single study attempting real-time analytics. Nevertheless, we succeeded in achieving an automated real-time stream of data accompanied by a statistical inference based on data extrapolated from Google Trends. Real-time analytics are of considerable impact when implemented in biological and life sciences as they will tremendously reduce the required resources for research. Predictive analytics, based on artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms, can be the next step to be deployed in continuation of the real-time systems to prognosticate changes in the temporal trends and the digital epidemiology of phenomena of interest. © 2019, CIC Edizioni Internazionali s.r.l..

N2  - Introduction Studies addressing the development and/or validation of diagnostic and prognostic prediction models are abundant in most clinical domains. Systematic reviews have shown that the methodological and reporting quality of prediction model studies is suboptimal. Due to the increasing availability of larger, routinely collected and complex medical data, and the rising application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) techniques, the number of prediction model studies is expected to increase even further. Prediction models developed using AI or ML techniques are often labelled as a 'black box' and little is known about their methodological and reporting quality. Therefore, this comprehensive systematic review aims to evaluate the reporting quality, the methodological conduct, and the risk of bias of prediction model studies that applied ML techniques for model development and/or validation. Methods and analysis A search will be performed in PubMed to identify studies developing and/or validating prediction models using any ML methodology and across all medical fields. Studies will be included if they were published between January 2018 and December 2019, predict patient-related outcomes, use any study design or data source, and available in English. Screening of search results and data extraction from included articles will be performed by two independent reviewers. The primary outcomes of this systematic review are: (1) the adherence of ML-based prediction model studies to the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD), and (2) the risk of bias in such studies as assessed using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). A narrative synthesis will be conducted for all included studies. Findings will be stratified by study type, medical field and prevalent ML methods, and will inform necessary extensions or updates of TRIPOD and PROBAST to better address prediction model studies that used AI or ML techniques. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this study because only available published data will be analysed. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and scientific conferences. Systematic review registration PROSPERO, CRD42019161764. ©

There are 651 bibliometrics articles in the LPP journal. Bibliometrics articles were first published in the LPP in 2000 and the number of bibliometrics research\ has been increasing over the last 10 years, particularly in 2019-2020, and this year is expected to increase further. The bibliometric article received the most contributions from India, followed by Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Iran. The topics covered in bibliometric studies include library and information science, coronavirus, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, social sciences and physics. The dataset used were mostly were from Scopus and Web of Science, with a few from DOAJ and Google Scholar. Citation analysis, productivity analysis, and collaborative analysis are three types of analysis that are commonly used in bibliometric articles in the LPP. The research recommendation provides a comprehensive overview of the development of publications, particularly bibliometrics, which can be used by researchers and journal managers to determine the direction of future journal topics. For further research, researchers can conduct a systematic literature review to delve deeper into the subject. © 2021

N2  - Purpose: Social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) method lacks of standard and code of practice. The aim of the study is to classify the wide variety of contributions on S-LCA for tracking the development of different themes and for defining and classifying the main approaches in a systematic and reproducible way. Methods: The research addressed to study a collection of 51 articles published between January 2006 and November 2014 using statistical criteria. We used automatic text analysis (ATA) tools related to lexicon analysis to identify keywords useful in tracing the main topics covered in articles published in different periods. We conducted principal component analysis (PCA) to classify the different approaches in the literature and to outline the orientations of the various research groups. Results and discussion: The results from lexicon analysis showed a rapid succession of different topics covered in the analyzed period. This alternation is strongly affected by the introduction of UNEP/Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) S-LCA guidelines and methodological sheets. PCA analysis enabled to synthesize the information related to the numerous approaches. Results did not show a clear division into groups which indicates the absence of a dominant position on the subject in the literature. Conclusions: This study attempted to map the state of art in S-LCA integrating literature review with multivariate statistical techniques. The analysis showed a highly fragmented field. These results confirm the existence of a variety of approaches that in part have already been identified by literature reviews on S-LCA. Alignment with the results in the literature confirms ATA to be a suitable instrument for the realization of reviews. Moreover, being systematic and reproducible allows ATA to be applied repeatedly, expanding the number of articles and topics analyzed. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to verify whether, in the tourism sector, the “family business model” is an important development opportunity and, in particular, if it is an innovation driver for this industry development. In the literature, there is no conclusive evidence of this for the tourism sector. In this context, the authors investigate personal and family needs and preferences alongside the relationship between family business model, growth and profit maximization and the development of tourism businesses through innovation drivers. Design/methodology/approach: To develop this topic, the authors conducted an extensive literature review considering the scientific papers published and contained mainly in database in the last 10 years (2010–2020) and focused the attention on the last five years. The authors ran content and structural analysis on the collected sources by main scientific databases (EBSCO, Scopus, Thomson Reuter, etc.). Based on a systematic literature review, the analysis was conducted using statistical criteria and bibliometric indicators. In detail, the authors used systematic literature review, bibliometric analysis and automatic text analysis (ATA) tools for identified lexicon analysis and strategic keywords and used statistical correlation to classify the different approaches in the literature and to outline the orientations of the various research groups. Findings: From this analysis, the correlation between tourism, hospitality, entrepreneurship, life cycle and innovation dynamics was analysed. Important research gaps are identified, and future research priorities are suggested. Implications for both family business and tourism theory are discussed. Originality/value: While the intersection between tourism management and family business model has been established in the literature, the number of related publications is still limited. Against this background, a literature review as a total analysis was an adequate and practicable research methodology. This paper proposes a comprehensive literature review and a reflection on the potential developments and applications for family business in the tourism sector. Authors also suggest several research directions that have not been adequately investigated yet. In particular, scholars do not seem to have caught all the implications of innovation adoption, especially for SMEs and family ownerships in tourism. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Background: The increasingly rapid rate of evidence publication has made it difficult for evidence synthesis—systematic reviews and health guidelines—to be continually kept up to date. One proposed solution for this is the use of automation in health evidence synthesis. Guideline developers are key gatekeepers in the acceptance and use of evidence, and therefore, their opinions on the potential use of automation are crucial. Methods: The objective of this study was to analyze the attitudes of guideline developers towards the use of automation in health evidence synthesis. The Diffusion of Innovations framework was chosen as an initial analytical framework because it encapsulates some of the core issues which are thought to affect the adoption of new innovations in practice. This well-established theory posits five dimensions which affect the adoption of novel technologies: Relative Advantage, Compatibility, Complexity, Trialability, and Observability. Eighteen interviews were conducted with individuals who were currently working, or had previously worked, in guideline development. After transcription, a multiphase mixed deductive and grounded approach was used to analyze the data. First, transcripts were coded with a deductive approach using Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation as the top-level themes. Second, sub-themes within the framework were identified using a grounded approach. Results: Participants were consistently most concerned with the extent to which an innovation is in line with current values and practices (i.e., Compatibility in the Diffusion of Innovations framework). Participants were also concerned with Relative Advantage and Observability, which were discussed in approximately equal amounts. For the latter, participants expressed a desire for transparency in the methodology of automation software. Participants were noticeably less interested in Complexity and Trialability, which were discussed infrequently. These results were reasonably consistent across all participants. Conclusions: If machine learning and other automation technologies are to be used more widely and to their full potential in systematic reviews and guideline development, it is crucial to ensure new technologies are in line with current values and practice. It will also be important to maximize the transparency of the methods of these technologies to address the concerns of guideline developers. © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Manual exploratory literature reviews should be a thing of the past, as technology and development of machine learning methods have matured. The learning curve for using machine learning methods is rapidly declining, enabling new possibilities for all researchers. A framework is presented on how to use topic modelling on a large collection of papers for an exploratory literature review and how that can be used for a full literature review. The aim of the paper is to enable the use of topic modelling for researchers by presenting a step-by-step framework on a case and sharing a code template. The framework consists of three steps; pre-processing, topic modelling, and post-processing, where the topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation is used. The framework enables huge amounts of papers to be reviewed in a transparent, reliable, faster, and reproducible way. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Framework of Socio-Technology Analysis and Prescriptions for a sustainable society: Focusing on the mobile technology case
AU  - Baek, H.

PD  - 
N2  - As 21st century society has evolved into a technology-centric society, the impact of innovative technologies on society continues to increase. The importance of innovative technologies to society is evidenced by the existence of various analytical methods, study results and actors. When we analyze the impact of technology on society, we often predict its future impact based on how technology has affected past and present trends in society. Analysis on the impact of technology on current trends in society is usually conducted by experts, but users, developers, or citizens might also participate. This study proposes an analytical framework termed ‘Socio-Technology Analysis and Prescriptions’ (STAP) that can be used to analyze the impact of innovative technologies on society and prescribes solutions to any associated problems in order to contribute to a sustainable society. When analyzing the impacts of technology on society, analysts can investigate the effects of technology on society based on a framework developed according to a specific theory. STAP is based on the comprehensive conceptual framework model from three Science and Technology Studies (STS), these are Technological Determinism (TD), Social Construction of Theory (SCOT), and Actor–Network Theory (ANT). This study adopted not only the perspectives of these three theories that describe the relationship between technology and society, but also takes a critical view of these theories in the process of creating the conceptual model of STAP. In order to verify a draft of STAP, this study extracted and applied keywords to find previous studies which relate to the impact of mobile technology on society using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology as part of the framework. A prominent feature of the SLR process is its use of natural language processing technology, which is an application of AI technology. In a test case, we successfully analyzed the impact of mobile technology on society through STAP showing it is possible to systematically analyze the impact of technology on society through our framework. The framework allowed us to identify the underlying causes of major problems and then present solutions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - This survey develops a dual analysis, consisting, first, in a bibliometric examination and, second, in a close literature review of all the scientific production around cryptocurrencies conducted in economics so far. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, proposes a methodological hybrid approach to perform comprehensive literature reviews. On the other hand, we provide an updated state of the art in cryptocurrency economic literature. Our methodology emerges as relevant when the topic comprises a large number of papers, which make unrealistic to perform a detailed reading of all the papers. This dual perspective offers a full landscape of cryptocurrency economic research. First, by means of the distant reading provided by machine learning bibliometric techniques, we are able to identify main topics, journals, key authors, and other macro aggregates. Second, based on the information provided by the previous stage, the traditional literature review provides a closer look at methodologies, data sources, and other details of the papers. In this way, we offer a classification and analysis of the mounting research produced in a relative short time span. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

PD  - 
N2  - BACKGROUND: Blood chemicals are routinely measured in clinical or preclinical research studies to diagnose diseases, assess risks in epidemiological research, or use metabolomic phenotyping in response to treatments. A vast volume of blood-related literature is available via the PubMed database for data mining. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to generate a comprehensive blood exposome database of endogenous and exogenous chemicals associated with the mammalian circulating system through text mining and database fusion. METHODS: Using NCBI resources, we retrieved PubMed abstracts, PubChem chemical synonyms, and PMC supplementary tables. We then employed text mining and PubChem crowdsourcing to associate phrases relating to blood with PubChem chemicals. False positives were removed by a phrase pattern and a compound exclusion list. RESULTS: A query to identify blood-related publications in the PubMed database yielded 1.1 million papers. Matching a total of 15 million synonyms from 6.5 million relevant PubChem chemicals against all blood-related publications yielded 37,514 chemicals and 851,999 publications records. Mapping PubChem compound identifiers to the PubMed database yielded 49,940 unique chemicals linked to 676,643 papers. Analysis of open-access metabolomics papers related to blood phrases in the PMC database yielded 4,039 unique compounds and 204 papers. Consolidating these three approaches summed up to a total of 41,474 achiral structures that were linked to 65,957 PubChem CIDs and to over 878,966 PubMed articles. We mapped these compounds to 50 databases such as those covering metabolites and pathways, governmental and toxicological databases, pharmacology resources, and bioassay repositories. In comparison, HMDB, the Human Metabolome Database, links 1,075 compounds to blood-related primary publications. CONCLUSION: This new Blood Exposome Database can be used for prioritizing chemicals for systematic reviews, developing target assays in exposome research, identifying compounds in untargeted mass spectrometry, and biological interpretation in metabolomics data.

PD  - 
N2  - The objective of systematic reviews is to address a research question by summarizing relevant studies following a detailed, comprehensive, and transparent plan and search protocol to reduce bias. Systematic reviews are very useful in the biomedical and healthcare domain; however, the data extraction phase of the systematic review process necessitates substantive expertise and is labour-intensive and time-consuming. The aim of this work is to partially automate the process of building systematic radiotherapy treatment literature reviews by summarizing the required data elements of geometric errors of radiotherapy from relevant literature using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) approaches. A framework is developed in this study that initially builds a training corpus by extracting sentences containing different types of geometric errors of radiotherapy from relevant publications. The publications are retrieved from PubMed following a given set of rules defined by a domain expert. Subsequently, the method develops a training corpus by extracting relevant sentences using a sentence similarity measure. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is then trained on this training corpus to extract the sentences from new publications which contain relevant geometric errors. To demonstrate the proposed approach, we have used 60 publications containing geometric errors in radiotherapy to automatically extract the sentences stating the mean and standard deviation of different types of errors between planned and executed radiotherapy. The experimental results show that the recall and precision of the proposed framework are, respectively, 97% and 72%. The results clearly show that the framework is able to extract almost all sentences containing required data of geometric errors. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - The response of pathophysiological research to emerging epidemics often occurs after the epidemic and, as a consequence, has little to no impact on improving patient outcomes or on developing high-quality evidence to inform clinical management strategies during the epidemic. Rapid and informed guidance of epidemic (research) responses to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires quick compilation and integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge. As a case study we chose the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that started in 2015 to develop a proof-of-concept knowledge repository. To extract data from available sources and build a computationally tractable and comprehensive molecular interaction map we applied generic knowledge management software for literature mining, expert knowledge curation, data integration, reporting and visualization. A multi-disciplinary team of experts, including clinicians, virologists, bioinformaticians and knowledge management specialists, followed a pre-defined workflow for rapid integration and evaluation of available evidence. While conventional approaches usually require months to comb through the existing literature, the initial ZIKV KnowledgeBase (ZIKA KB) was completed within a few weeks. Recently we updated the ZIKA KB with additional curated data from the large amount of literature published since 2016 and made it publicly available through a web interface together with a step-by-step guide to ensure reproducibility of the described use case. In addition, a detailed online user manual is provided to enable the ZIKV research community to generate hypotheses, share knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and interactively explore and interpret data. A workflow for rapid response during outbreaks was generated, validated and refined and is also made available. The process described here can be used for timely structuring of pathophysiological knowledge for future threats. The resulting structured biological knowledge is a helpful tool for computational data analysis and generation of predictive models and opens new avenues for infectious disease research.

PD  - 
N2  - This article maps the scientific literature in human mobility behavior in the context of the current pandemic. Through bibliometrics, we analyze the content of published scientific studies indexed on the Web of Science and Scopus during 2020. This enables us the detection of current hotspots and future directions of research. After a co-occurrence of keywords and evidence map analysis, four themes are identified, namely, Land Transport — Operations, Land Transport — Traffic Demand, Air Transport and Environment. We show how air transportation- and environmental-related studies tend to be more mature research whereas the understanding of changes in travel behavior (e.g., telecommuting, preventive measures or health protection behavior) tends to be immature. By using a topic modeling approach, we identify multiple sub-themes within each theme. Our framework adopts a smart literature review approach that can be constantly updated, enabling an analysis of many articles, with little investment of the researcher's time, but also provides high degree of transparency and replicability. We also put forth a research agenda that can help inform and shape transport policy and practice responses to COVID-19. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Groundwater (GW) is a critical freshwater resource for billions of individuals worldwide. Rapid anthropogenic exploitation has increasingly deteriorated GW quality and quantity. Reliable estimation of complex hydrochemical properties of GW is crucial for sustainable development. Real field and experimental studies in an agricultural area from the significant sandstone aquifers (Wajid Aquifer) were conducted. For the modelling purpose, three types of computational models, including the emerging Hammerstein–Wiener (HW), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and statistical multi-variate regression (MVR), were developed for the multi-station estimation of total dissolved solids (TDS) (mg/L) and total hardness (TH) (mg/L). A geographic information system (GIS) was used for the spatial variability assessment of 32 hydrochemical and physical properties of the GW aquifer. A comprehensive visualized literature review spanning several decades was conducted in order to gain an understanding of the existing research and debates relevant to a particular GW and artificial intelligence (AI) study. The experimental data, pre-processing, and feature selection were conducted to determine the most dominant variables for AI-based modelling. The estimation results were evaluated using determination coefficient (DC), mean bias error (MBE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The outcomes proved that TDS (mg/L) and TH (mg/L) correlated more than 90% and 70–85% with Ca2+, Cl−, Br−, NO3−, and Fe, and Na+, SO42−, Mg2+, and F− combinations, respectively. HW-M1 justified promising among all the models with MBE = 1.41 × 10−11, 1.14 × 10−14, and MSE = 7.52 × 10−2, 3.88 × 10−11 for TDS (mg/L), TH (mg/L), respectively. The accuracy proved merit for the overall development of and practical estimation of hydrochemical variables (TDS, TH) (mg/L) and decision-making benchmarks. © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the knowledge gaps in the extant literature on the role of ambidexterity and coopetition in designing resilient fashion supply chains (RFSCs), and to develop a contextual framework for effective decision-making to enable practitioners to enhance their supply chain resilience. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a novel multi-evidence-based approach comprising Denyer and Tranfield's (2009) systematic literature review (SLR) with context, intervention, mechanism and outcome (CIMO) logic, text mining and network analysis. The approach constitutes a rigorous methodology that cross-validates results and ensures the reliability and validity of findings. Findings: The authors identified key knowledge gaps in the literature and explored the main contribution categories (e.g. conceptual understandings, operational impacts, use of theories and frameworks). Subsequently, we developed a contextual framework of ambidextrous coopetition to design RFSCs. Finally, an empirical research agenda is proposed with the five research directions to address the gap and take forward the notion of ambidextrous coopetition and RFSCs. Research limitations/implications: The multi-evidence-based approach is a structured and triangulated SLR approach and thus lacks empirical study. Practical implications: This research proposes a contextual framework of ambidextrous coopetition that can be used by fashion companies to embed resilience into their structures and operations. This research also presents an agenda for the future empirical research. Originality/value: This paper contributes by providing a combinatory synthesis on the role of ambidexterity and coopetition in designing RFSCs. This paper introduces a novel methodological triangulation for improving the quality and validity of SLRs. It identifies significant knowledge gaps and defines directions for future research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

PD  - 
N2  - Preparing a systematic review can take hundreds of hours to complete, but the process of reconciling different results from multiple studies is the bedrock of evidence-based medicine. We introduce a two-step approach to automatically extract three facets - two entities (the agent and object) and the way in which the entities are compared (the endpoint) - from direct comparative sentences in full-text articles. The system does not require a user to predefine entities in advance and thus can be used in domains where entity recognition is difficult or unavailable. As with a systematic review, the tabular summary produced using the automatically extracted facets shows how experimental results differ between studies. Experiments were conducted using a collection of more than 2million sentences from three journals Diabetes, Carcinogenesis and Endocrinology and two machine learning algorithms, support vector machines (SVM) and a general linear model (GLM). F1 and accuracy measures for the SVM and GLM differed by only 0.01 across all three comparison facets in a randomly selected set of test sentences. The system achieved the best performance of 92% for objects, whereas the accuracy for both agent and endpoints was 73%. F1 scores were higher for objects (0.77) than for endpoints (0.51) or agents (0.47). A situated evaluation of Metformin, a drug to treat diabetes, showed system accuracy of 95%, 83% and 79% for the object, endpoint and agent respectively. The situated evaluation had higher F1 scores of 0.88, 0.64 and 0.62 for object, endpoint, and agent respectively. On average, only 5.31% of the sentences in a full-text article are direct comparisons, but the tabular summaries suggest that these sentences provide a rich source of currently underutilized information that can be used to accelerate the systematic review process and identify gaps where future research should be focused. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..

N2  - Background: Full-text searches of articles increase the recall, defined by the proportion of relevant publications that are retrieved. However, this method is rarely used in medical research due to resource constraints. For the purpose of a systematic review of publications addressing shared decision making, a full-text search method was required to retrieve publications where shared decision making does not appear in the title or abstract. Objective: The objective of our study was to assess the efficiency and reliability of full-text searches in major medical journals for identifying shared decision making publications. Methods: A full-text search was performed on the websites of 15 high-impact journals in general internal medicine to look up publications of any type from 1996-2011 containing the phrase "shared decision making". The search method was compared with a PubMed search of titles and abstracts only. The full-text search was further validated by requesting all publications from the same time period from the individual journal publishers and searching through the collected dataset. Results: The full-text search for "shared decision making" on journal websites identified 1286 publications in 15 journals compared to 119 through the PubMed search. The search within the publisher-provided publications of 6 journals identified 613 publications compared to 646 with the full-text search on the respective journal websites. The concordance rate was 94.3% between both full-text searches. Conclusions: Full-text searching on medical journal websites is an efficient and reliable way to identify relevant articles in the field of shared decision making for review or other purposes. It may be more widely used in biomedical research in other fields in the future, with the collaboration of publishers and journals toward open-access data. © 2015 JMIR Publications Inc.

N2  - News organizations constitute key sites of science communication between experts and lay audiences, giving many individuals their basic worldview of complex topics like climate change. Previous researchers have studied climate change news coverage to assess accuracy in reporting and potential sources of bias. These studies typically rely on manually coding articles from a handful of prestigious outlets, not allowing comparisons with smaller newspapers or providing enough diversity to assess the influence of partisan orientation or localized climate vulnerability on content production. Making these comparisons, this study indicates that partisan orientation, scale of circulation, and vulnerability to climate change correlate with several topics present in U.S. newspaper coverage of climate change. After assembling a corpus of over 78,000 articles covering two decades from 52 U.S. newspapers that are diverse in terms of geography, partisan orientation, scale of circulation, and objectively measured climate risk, a coherent set of latent topics were identified via an automated content analysis of climate change news coverage. Topic model results indicate that while outlet bias does not appear to impact the prevalence of coverage for most topics surrounding climate change, differences were evident for some topics based on partisan orientation, scale, or vulnerability status, particularly those relating to climate change denial, impacts, mitigation, or resource use. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive study of U.S. newspaper coverage of climate change and identifies specific topics where outlet bias constitutes an important contextual factor. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background: Globally, 36% of deaths among children can be attributed to environmental factors. However, no comprehensive list of environmental exposures exists. We seek to address this gap by developing a literaturemining algorithm to catalog prenatal environmental exposures. Methods: We designed a framework called PEPPER: Prenatal Exposure PubMed ParsER to a) catalog prenatal exposures studied in the literature and b) identify study type. Using PubMed Central, PEPPER classifies article type (methodology, systematic review) and catalogs prenatal exposures. We coupled PEPPER with the FDA's food additive database to form a master set of exposures. Results: We found that of 31 764 prenatal exposure studies only 53.0% were methodology studies. PEPPER consists of 219 prenatal exposures, including a common set of 43 exposures. PEPPER captured prenatal exposures from 56.4% of methodology studies (9492/16 832 studies). Two raters independently reviewed 50 randomly selected articles and annotated presence of exposures and study methodology type. Error rates for PEPPER's exposure assignment ranged from 0.56% to 1.30% depending on the rater. Evaluation of the study type assignment showed agreement ranging from 96% to 100% (kappa=0.909, p<.001). Using a gold-standard set of relevant prenatal exposure studies, PEPPER achieved a recall of 94.4%. Conclusions: Using curated exposures and food additives; PEPPER provides the first comprehensive list of 219 prenatal exposures studied in methodology papers. On average, 1.45 exposures were investigated per study. PEPPER successfully distinguished article type for all prenatal studies allowing literature gaps to be easily identified. © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Creating search strategies for systematic reviews, finding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity, and translating search strategies between databases is challenging. Several methods describe standards for systematic search strategies, but a consistent approach for creating an exhaustive search strategy has not yet been fully described in enough detail to be fully replicable. The authors have established a method that describes step by step the process of developing a systematic search strategy as needed in the systematic review. This method describes how single-line search strategies can be prepared in a text document by typing search syntax (such as field codes, parentheses, and Boolean operators) before copying and pasting search terms (keywords and free-text synonyms) that are found in the thesaurus. To help ensure term completeness, we developed a novel optimization technique that is mainly based on comparing the results retrieved by thesaurus terms with those retrieved by the free-text search words to identify potentially relevant candidate search terms. Macros in Microsoft Word have been developed to convert syntaxes between databases and interfaces almost automatically. This method helps information specialists in developing librarian-mediated searches for systematic reviews as well as medical and health care practitioners who are searching for evidence to answer clinical questions. The described method can be used to create complex and comprehensive search strategies for different databases and interfaces, such as those that are needed when searching for relevant references for systematic reviews, and will assist both information specialists and practitioners when they are searching the biomedical literature. © 2018, Medical Library Association.

N2  - Bibliometric studies of entrepreneurship as a discipline have contributed fundamentally to the creation of a certain order in an apparently chaotic and contradictory literature, examining how the discipline has developed, giving a comprehensive vision of the structure of the field, observing its social networks, detecting trends, discovering knowledge gaps and helping to plan future research lines. The purpose of this article is to explore this special type of research. In terms of methodology, it uses an adaptation of the Systematic Literature Review, and a content analysis using text-mining software in order to look deeper into objectives, conclusions and limitations. Among the main findings, there is some evidence that indicates that the image presented to date about entrepreneurship has not considered the multidisciplinary nature of the field and could, therefore, be distorted. At the same time, a series of inherent problems have been detected, and it has become evident that there is a need to incorporate the latest advances in bibliometrics and to improve collaboration between experts from both fields in order to solve those mentioned issues and move towards future progress. © 2020 CSIC.

N2  - Background: Natural language processing (NLP) has a significant role in advancing healthcare and has been found to be key in extracting structured information from radiology reports. Understanding recent developments in NLP application to radiology is of significance but recent reviews on this are limited. This study systematically assesses and quantifies recent literature in NLP applied to radiology reports. Methods: We conduct an automated literature search yielding 4836 results using automated filtering, metadata enriching steps and citation search combined with manual review. Our analysis is based on 21 variables including radiology characteristics, NLP methodology, performance, study, and clinical application characteristics. Results: We present a comprehensive analysis of the 164 publications retrieved with publications in 2019 almost triple those in 2015. Each publication is categorised into one of 6 clinical application categories. Deep learning use increases in the period but conventional machine learning approaches are still prevalent. Deep learning remains challenged when data is scarce and there is little evidence of adoption into clinical practice. Despite 17% of studies reporting greater than 0.85 F1 scores, it is hard to comparatively evaluate these approaches given that most of them use different datasets. Only 14 studies made their data and 15 their code available with 10 externally validating results. Conclusions: Automated understanding of clinical narratives of the radiology reports has the potential to enhance the healthcare process and we show that research in this field continues to grow. Reproducibility and explainability of models are important if the domain is to move applications into clinical use. More could be done to share code enabling validation of methods on different institutional data and to reduce heterogeneity in reporting of study properties allowing inter-study comparisons. Our results have significance for researchers in the field providing a systematic synthesis of existing work to build on, identify gaps, opportunities for collaboration and avoid duplication. © 2021, The Author(s).

PD  - 
N2  - The integration of passenger and freight transport has been the subject of debate among scholars from the beginning of the century, with a peak observed in the last five years. Considering the relatively recent interest in the topic, most authors have highlighted the heterogeneous and explorative approaches adopted so far, indicating a lack of systematic analyses. This is confirmed by the different names given to the same concept (e.g., co-modality, cargo hitching, system with mixed passengers and goods, share-a-ride, integrated passenger and freight logistics, and collaborative passenger and freight transport). This study conducts a comprehensive literature review based on the scientific contributions indexed in Scopus and selected through a semiautomatic data extraction. First, a descriptive analysis is conducted, which includes types of publication, geographical areas, sources of publication, research methods, and research design adopted. Then, a text mining analysis identifies the main content-related aspects, including a semantic investigation of the most frequently occurring terms, their clustering in homogeneous groups, the transport means considered, and the territorial scales that have been investigated. This analysis is used to define the future challenges related to the topic, which span from the provision of more robust quantitative analyses (studies providing real data and adopting ad-hoc models are still very limited) to policy-related issues. However, the definition of a normative framework that integrates both systems is essential to deal with passenger–freight transport in a combined manner. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide the highest level of evidence to help inform policy and practice, yet their rigorous nature is associated with significant time and economic demands. The screening of titles and abstracts is the most time consuming part of the review process with analysts required review thousands of articles manually, taking on average 33 days. New technologies aimed at streamlining the screening process have provided initial promising findings, yet there are limitations with current approaches and barriers to the widespread use of these tools. In this paper, we introduce and report initial evidence on the utility of Research Screener, a semi-automated machine learning tool to facilitate abstract screening. Methods: Three sets of analyses (simulation, interactive and sensitivity) were conducted to provide evidence of the utility of the tool through both simulated and real-world examples. Results: Research Screener delivered a workload saving of between 60 and 96% across nine systematic reviews and two scoping reviews. Findings from the real-world interactive analysis demonstrated a time saving of 12.53 days compared to the manual screening, which equates to a financial saving of USD 2444. Conservatively, our results suggest that analysts who scan 50% of the total pool of articles identified via a systematic search are highly likely to have identified 100% of eligible papers. Conclusions: In light of these findings, Research Screener is able to reduce the burden for researchers wishing to conduct a comprehensive systematic review without reducing the scientific rigour for which they strive to achieve. © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Research in machine learning has become very popular in recent years, with many types of models proposed to comprehend and predict patterns and trends in data originating from different domains. As these models get more and more complex, it also becomes harder for users to assess and trust their results, since their internal operations are mostly hidden in black boxes. The interpretation of machine learning models is currently a hot topic in the information visualization community, with results showing that insights from machine learning models can lead to better predictions and improve the trustworthiness of the results. Due to this, multiple (and extensive) survey articles have been published recently trying to summarize the high number of original research papers published on the topic. But there is not always a clear definition of what these surveys cover, what is the overlap between them, which types of machine learning models they deal with, or what exactly is the scenario that the readers will find in each of them. In this article, we present a meta-analysis (i.e. a “survey of surveys”) of manually collected survey papers that refer to the visual interpretation of machine learning models, including the papers discussed in the selected surveys. The aim of our article is to serve both as a detailed summary and as a guide through this survey ecosystem by acquiring, cataloging, and presenting fundamental knowledge of the state of the art and research opportunities in the area. Our results confirm the increasing trend of interpreting machine learning with visualizations in the past years, and that visualization can assist in, for example, online training processes of deep learning models and enhancing trust into machine learning. However, the question of exactly how this assistance should take place is still considered as an open challenge of the visualization community. © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - This study extends the existing reviews targeting the Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice (JPIEEP) by incorporating the text-mining review methodology. A total of 1,810 papers published in JPIEEP since 1982 were selected as the literature sample. Dividing the whole sample into four subsamples according to publication time spans, this review indicates that literature published before 2000, especially articles from the 1982 to 1991 period, emphasized more civil engineering-related practical and practical issues (e.g., legislation). Since the early 2000s, literature from JPIEEP has been focusing more on engineering education-based research, such as teaching methods and undergraduate education. Specifically, more recent studies show emerging topics of education and practical subjects (i.e., BIM and sustainability), pedagogical approaches (i.e., problem-based learning, active learning, simulation, teamwork, and distance education), and diversity issues. Accordingly, future research directions are proposed, such as integration of emerging pedagogical methods in the emerging subjects (e.g., BIM). This study contributes to the review of engineering education and practice by demonstrating that the text-mining approach could be reproduced to assist other review-based studies. Finally, this study addresses questions regarding the latest research topics and proposes directions for future scholarly work. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Background and Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe mortality across the globe, with the USA as the current epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic even though the initial outbreak was in Wuhan, China. Many studies successfully applied machine learning to fight COVID-19 pandemic from a different perspective. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no comprehensive survey with bibliometric analysis has been conducted yet on the adoption of machine learning to fight COVID-19. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to bridge this gap by carrying out an in-depth survey with bibliometric analysis on the adoption of machine learning-based technologies to fight COVID-19 pandemic from a different perspective, including an extensive systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis. Methods: We applied a literature survey methodology to retrieved data from academic databases and subsequently employed a bibliometric technique to analyze the accessed records. Besides, the concise summary, sources of COVID-19 datasets, taxonomy, synthesis and analysis are presented in this study. It was found that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is mainly utilized in developing COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis tools, mostly from chest X-ray and chest CT scan images. Similarly, in this study, we performed a bibliometric analysis of machine learning-based COVID-19 related publications in the Scopus and Web of Science citation indexes. Finally, we propose a new perspective for solving the challenges identified as direction for future research. We believe the survey with bibliometric analysis can help researchers easily detect areas that require further development and identify potential collaborators. Results: The findings of the analysis presented in this article reveal that machine learning-based COVID-19 diagnose tools received the most considerable attention from researchers. Specifically, the analyses of results show that energy and resources are more dispenses towards COVID-19 automated diagnose tools while COVID-19 drugs and vaccine development remains grossly underexploited. Besides, the machine learning-based algorithm that is predominantly utilized by researchers in developing the diagnostic tool is CNN mainly from X-rays and CT scan images. Conclusions: The challenges hindering practical work on the application of machine learning-based technologies to fight COVID-19 and new perspective to solve the identified problems are presented in this article. Furthermore, we believed that the presented survey with bibliometric analysis could make it easier for researchers to identify areas that need further development and possibly identify potential collaborators at author, country and institutional level, with the overall aim of furthering research in the focused area of machine learning application to disease control. © 2020.

N2  - Deep learning models have achieved high performance across different domains, such as medical decision-making, autonomous vehicles, decision support systems, among many others. However, despite this success, the inner mechanisms of these models are opaque because their internal representations are too complex for a human to understand. This opacity makes it hard to understand the how or the why of the predictions of deep learning models. There has been a growing interest in model-agnostic methods that make deep learning models more transparent and explainable to humans. Some researchers recently argued that for a machine to achieve human-level explainability, this machine needs to provide human causally understandable explanations, also known as causability. A specific class of algorithms that have the potential to provide causability are counterfactuals. This paper presents an in-depth systematic review of the diverse existing literature on counterfactuals and causability for explainable artificial intelligence (AI). We performed a Latent Dirichlet topic modelling analysis (LDA) under a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework to find the most relevant literature articles. This analysis yielded a novel taxonomy that considers the grounding theories of the surveyed algorithms, together with their underlying properties and applications to real-world data. Our research suggests that current model-agnostic counterfactual algorithms for explainable AI are not grounded on a causal theoretical formalism and, consequently, cannot promote causability to a human decision-maker. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the explanations derived from popular algorithms in the literature provide spurious correlations rather than cause/effects relationships, leading to sub-optimal, erroneous, or even biased explanations. Thus, this paper also advances the literature with new directions and challenges on promoting causability in model-agnostic approaches for explainable AI. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The Medical Subject Heading 'Humans' is manually curated and indicates human-related studies within MEDLINE. However, newly published MEDLINE articles may take months to be indexed and non-MEDLINE articles lack consistent, transparent indexing of this feature. Therefore, for up to date and broad literature searches, there is a need for an independent automated system to identify whether a given publication is human-related, particularly when they lack Medical Subject Headings. One million MEDLINE records published in 1987-2014 were randomly selected. Text-based features from the title, abstract, author name and journal fields were extracted. A linear support vector machine was trained to estimate the probability that a given article should be indexed as Humans and was evaluated on records from 2015 to 2016. Overall accuracy was high: area under the receiver operating curve = 0.976, F1 = 95% relative to MeSH indexing. Manual review of cases of extreme disagreement with MEDLINE showed 73.5% agreement with the automated prediction. We have tagged all articles indexed in PubMed with predictive scores and have made the information publicly available at http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/evidence-based-medicine/index.html. We have also made available a web-based interface to allow users to obtain predictive scores for non-MEDLINE articles. This will assist in the triage of clinical evidence for writing systematic reviews. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

N2  - Operational risks are increasingly prevalent and complex to manage in organisations, culminating in substantial financial and non-financial costs. Given the inefficiencies and biases of traditional manual, static and qualitative risk management practices, research has progressed to using data analytics to objectively and dynamically manage risks. However, the variety of operational risks, techniques and objectives researched is not well mapped across industries. This paper thoroughly reviews the emerging research area applying data analytics to operational risk management (ORM) within financial services (FS) and energy and natural resources (ENR). A systematic literature search resulted in 2,538 publications, from which detailed bibliometric and content analyses are performed on 191 studies of relevance. The literature is classified using a novel multi-layered framework, informing critical analyses of the analytics techniques and data employed. Five core themes emerge, relevant to practitioners, researchers, educators and students across any sector: risk identification, causal factors, risk quantification, risk prediction and risk decision-making. Generally, ENR studies focus on identifying causal factors and predicting specific incidents, whereas FS applications are more mature surrounding risk quantification. To conclude, the comprehensive review reveals areas where further research is needed to advance ORM within and beyond FS and ENR, in pursuit of improved decision-making. © 2022 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: The extraction of data from the reports of primary studies, on which the results of systematic reviews depend, needs to be carried out accurately. To aid reliability, it is recommended that two researchers carry out data extraction independently. The extraction of statistical data from graphs in PDF files is particularly challenging, as the process is usually completely manual, and reviewers need sometimes to revert to holding a ruler against the page to read off values: an inherently time-consuming and error-prone process. Methods: To mitigate some of the above problems we integrated and customised two existing JavaScript libraries to create a new web-based graphical data extraction tool to assist reviewers in extracting data from graphs. This tool aims to facilitate more accurate and timely data extraction through a user interface which can be used to extract data through mouse clicks. We carried out a non-inferiority evaluation to examine its performance in comparison to standard practice. Results: We found that the customised graphical data extraction tool is not inferior to users’ prior preferred current approaches. Our study was not designed to show superiority, but suggests that there may be a saving in time of around 6 minutes per graph, accompanied by a substantial increase in accuracy. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the incorporation of this type of tool in online systematic review software would be beneficial in facilitating the production of accurate and timely evidence synthesis to improve decision-making. © 2019 Cramond F et al.

N2  - This article brings two major contributions. First, we present the results of a critical analysis of recent scientific articles about neural and non-neural approaches and representations for automatic text classification (ATC). This analysis is focused on assessing the scientific rigor of such studies. It reveals a profusion of potential issues related to the experimental procedures including: (i) use of inadequate experimental protocols, including no repetitions for the sake of assessing variability and generalization; (ii) lack of statistical treatment of the results; (iii) lack of details on hyperparameter tuning, especially of the baselines; (iv) use of inadequate measures of classification effectiveness (e.g., accuracy with skewed distributions). Second, we provide some organization and ground to the field by performing a comprehensive and scientifically sound comparison of recent neural and non-neural ATC solutions. Our study provides a more complete picture by looking beyond classification effectiveness, taking the trade-off between model costs (i.e., training time) into account. Our evaluation is guided by scientific rigor, which, as our literature review shows, is missing in a large body of work. Our experimental results, based on more than 1500 measurements, reveal that in the smaller datasets, the simplest and cheaper non-neural methods are among the best performers. In the larger datasets, neural Transformers perform better in terms of classification effectiveness. However, when compared to the best (properly tuned) non-neural solutions, the gains in effectiveness are not very expressive, especially considering the much longer training times (up to 23x slower). Our findings call for a self-reflection of best practices in the field, from the way experiments are conducted and analyzed to the choice of proper baselines for each situation and scenario. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - We report a systematic review and meta-analysis of research using animal models of chemotherapy- induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). We systematically searched 5 online databases in September 2012 and updated the search in November 2015 using machine learning and text mining to reduce the screening for inclusion workload and improve accuracy. For each comparison, we calculated a standardised mean difference (SMD) effect size, and then combined effects in a random-effects meta-analysis. We assessed the impact of study design factors and reporting of measures to reduce risks of bias. We present power analyses for the most frequently reported behavioural tests; 337 publications were included. Most studies (84%) used male animals only. The most frequently reported outcome measure was evoked limb withdrawal in response to mechanical monofilaments. There was modest reporting of measures to reduce risks of bias. The number of animals required to obtain 80% power with a significance level of 0.05 varied substantially across behavioural tests. In this comprehensive summary of the use of animal models of CIPN, we have identified areas in which the value of preclinical CIPN studies might be increased. Using both sexes of animals in the modelling of CIPN, ensuring that outcome measures align with those most relevant in the clinic, and the animal’s pain contextualised ethology will likely improve external validity. Measures to reduce risk of bias should be employed to increase the internal validity of studies. Different outcome measures have different statistical power, and this can refine our approaches in the modelling of CIPN. © 2019, Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.

N2  - This paper proposes an approach to capturing and reviewing scientific literature addressing latent topics across multiple scientific fields. As latent topics like moral values are affected by word polysemy and synonymy, a traditional keyword-based approach is often ineffective and therefore inappropriate. As a result, scientific literature addressing latent topics tends to be fragmented thereby constraining efforts to address similar and complementary research challenges. A novel approach to reviewing the literature by utilizing both semantic fields and probabilistic topic models has therefore been developed. We illustrate this approach by reviewing the literature addressing the value justice in the energy sector and compare this with a regular keyword-based approach. The new approach results in a more complete overview of the relevance of energy justice as compared to the traditional keyword-based approach. This novel approach can be applied to other latent topics including other values or phenomena such as societal resistance to technologies, thereby leading to an increased understanding of existing relevant literature and the identification of new areas of research. © 2018 The Authors

N2  - To our knowledge, no publication providing overarching guidance on the conduct of systematic reviews of observational studies of etiology exists. Methods and findings Conducting Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Observational Studies of Etiology (COSMOS-E) provides guidance on all steps in systematic reviews of observational studies of etiology, from shaping the research question, defining exposure and outcomes, to assessing the risk of bias and statistical analysis. The writing group included researchers experienced in meta-analyses and observational studies of etiology. Standard peer-review was performed. While the structure of systematic reviews of observational studies on etiology may be similar to that for systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials, there are specific tasks within each component that differ. Examples include assessment for confounding, selection bias, and information bias. In systematic reviews of observational studies of etiology, combining studies in meta-analysis may lead to more precise estimates, but such greater precision does not automatically remedy potential bias. Thorough exploration of sources of heterogeneity is key when assessing the validity of estimates and causality. Conclusion As many reviews of observational studies on etiology are being performed, this document may provide researchers with guidance on how to conduct and analyse such reviews. © 2019 Dekkers et al.

N2  - This paper investigates the literary corpus on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the construction of sustainable business models (SBMs). It provides a quantitative overview of the academic literature that constitutes the field. The paper discusses the relationships between AI and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development (SD). Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI's association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. Thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: In recent years large bibliographic databases have made much of the published literature of biology available for searches. However, the capabilities of the search engines integrated into these databases for text-based bibliographic searches are limited. To enable searches that deliver the results expected by comparative anatomists, an underlying logical structure known as an ontology is required. Development and Testing of the Ontology: Here we present the Mammalian Feeding Muscle Ontology (MFMO), a multi-species ontology focused on anatomical structures that participate in feeding and other oral/pharyngeal behaviors. A unique feature of the MFMO is that a simple, computable, definition of each muscle, which includes its attachments and innervation, is true across mammals. This construction mirrors the logical foundation of comparative anatomy and permits searches using language familiar to biologists. Further, it provides a template for muscles that will be useful in extending any anatomy ontology. The MFMO is developed to support the Feeding Experiments End-User Database Project (FEED, https://feedexp.org/), a publicly-available, online repository for physiological data collected from in vivo studies of feeding (e.g., mastication, biting, swallowing) in mammals. Currently the MFMO is integrated into FEED and also into two literature-specific implementations of Textpresso, a text-mining system that facilitates powerful searches of a corpus of scientific publications. We evaluate the MFMO by asking questions that test the ability of the ontology to return appropriate answers (competency questions). We compare the results of queries of the MFMO to results from similar searches in PubMed and Google Scholar. Results and Significance: Our tests demonstrate that the MFMO is competent to answer queries formed in the common language of comparative anatomy, but PubMed and Google Scholar are not. Overall, our results show that by incorporating anatomical ontologies into searches, an expanded and anatomically comprehensive set of results can be obtained. The broader scientific and publishing communities should consider taking up the challenge of semantically enabled search capabilities.

N2  - Validation is a crucial step in environmental and economic modeling that establishes the reliability of models to be used in decision-making contexts. It is often said that validation approaches proposed in the literature are not widely adopted, and different modeling fields do not benefit from each other. This study analyses a broad academic literature on model validation, mainly in environmental and decision sciences, by using an innovative combination of bibliometric and text-mining tools. The results show that a data-driven validation practice is prevalent. Although most publications in the studied dataset resemble each other, the most-cited ones tend to be different from the rest in terms of their abstracts’ content. Furthermore, the validation practices in different modeling areas are distinct, and do not extensively cite each other. In future, validation approaches can extend beyond data-oriented reliability for a wider acceptance of modeling in decision-making, and can synthesize the methods and views from various fields. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background: Given the worldwide spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), there is an urgent need to identify risk and protective factors and expose areas of insufficient understanding. Emerging tools, such as the Rapid Evidence Map (rEM), are being developed to systematically characterize large collections of scientific literature. We sought to generate an rEM of risk and protective factors to comprehensively inform areas that impact COVID-19 outcomes for different sub-populations in order to better protect the public. Methods: We developed a protocol that includes a study goal, study questions, a PECO statement, and a process for screening literature by combining semi-automated machine learning with the expertise of our review team. We applied this protocol to reports within the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) that were published in early 2020. SWIFT-Active Screener was used to prioritize records according to pre-defined inclusion criteria. Relevant studies were categorized by risk and protective status; susceptibility category (Behavioral, Physiological, Demographic, and Environmental); and affected sub-populations. Using tagged studies, we created an rEM for COVID-19 susceptibility that reveals: (1) current lines of evidence; (2) knowledge gaps; and (3) areas that may benefit from systematic review. Results: We imported 4,330 titles and abstracts from CORD-19. After screening 3,521 of these to achieve 99% estimated recall, 217 relevant studies were identified. Most included studies concerned the impact of underlying comorbidities (Physiological); age and gender (Demographic); and social factors (Environmental) on COVID-19 outcomes. Among the relevant studies, older males with comorbidities were commonly reported to have the poorest outcomes. We noted a paucity of COVID-19 studies among children and susceptible sub-groups, including pregnant women, racial minorities, refugees/migrants, and healthcare workers, with few studies examining protective factors. Conclusion: Using rEM analysis, we synthesized the recent body of evidence related to COVID-19 risk and protective factors. The results provide a comprehensive tool for rapidly elucidating COVID-19 susceptibility patterns and identifying resource-rich/resource-poor areas of research that may benefit from future investigation as the pandemic evolves. © Copyright © 2020 Elmore, Schmidt, Lam, Howard, Tandon, Norman, Phillips, Shah, Patel, Albert, Taxman and Shah.

N2  - Introduction: Community resilience (CR) has gradually become a hot topic in uncertain times, especially in the last five years. The current study presents a systematic review based on content analysis to present a knowledge graph of CR research over the last 20 years. Methods: We use an approach of Leximancer to conduct the content analysis to explore the intellectual foundations, research context, topics, and methods of CR literature based on 583 published studies. Results: The results show that framework research of CR is a hot topic throughout the last 20 years. In the first stage (from 2001 to 2015), CR connected with the themes of “frame-work, disaster, change, and model”. Comparatively, in the second stage (from 2016 to 2020), the themes of “social capital, capacity, and framework” are more salient connecting with CR. Additionally, the study detected that the key issues varied across countries. Specifically, research in the US focused on the social support dynamic, while in Australia, recovery from the disaster was the predominant theme. Furthermore, in the UK, studies mostly explore resilience issues in the background related to flooding. Discussion: Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of CR research covering the last 20 years and put forward thoughts and recommendations for future resilience studies con-sidering 1) obstacles within daily life, 2) resilience set within organizational perspectives, and 3) cultural context. © 2021 Fan and Lyu.

N2  - Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is an information-based process throughout which each stage must be carefully and systematically designed in planning phase. Important decisions need to be made about the various choices involved in the SLR planning phase. However, due to the necessarily comprehensive and rigorous nature of SLR, many researchers have difficulties in planning SLRs sufficiently and effectively. In recent decades, the use of text mining (TM) techniques has been introduced to facilitate SLR process, especially at conducting review phase to support the searching and selection of studies. However, so far, TM techniques have not been applied to support any activities during SLR planning phase. In this research, we proposed a method that apply Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) method to support decision-making activities within the SLR planning phase. This method also known as SLR Planning Based on Suffix Tree Clustering (SLRP-STC) method. It aims to help reviewers in three ways: 1) to extract research topics easily; 2) to better interpret extracted information; and 3) to quickly realize and refine a proposed search string that is poorly formulated or inappropriate. A case study was conducted by comparing the proposed method with manual approach. It is observed that the use of SLRP-STC method can improve the planning of SLR.

N2  - PubMed is a free search engine for biomedical literature accessed by millions of users from around the world each day. With the rapid growth of biomedical literature—about two articles are added every minute on average—finding and retrieving the most relevant papers for a given query is increasingly challenging. We present Best Match, a new relevance search algorithm for PubMed that leverages the intelligence of our users and cutting-edge machine-learning technology as an alternative to the traditional date sort order. The Best Match algorithm is trained with past user searches with dozens of relevance-ranking signals (factors), the most important being the past usage of an article, publication date, relevance score, and type of article. This new algorithm demonstrates state-of-the-art retrieval performance in benchmarking experiments as well as an improved user experience in real-world testing (over 20% increase in user click-through rate). Since its deployment in June 2017, we have observed a significant increase (60%) in PubMed searches with relevance sort order: it now assists millions of PubMed searches each week. In this work, we hope to increase the awareness and transparency of this new relevance sort option for PubMed users, enabling them to retrieve information more effectively. © 2018, Public Library of Science.

N2  - PubMed is a widely used search engine for biomedical literature. It is developed and maintained by the US National Library of Medicine/National Center for Biotechnology Information and is visited daily by millions of users around the world. For decades, PubMed has used advanced artificial intelligence technologies that extract patterns of collective user activity, such as machine learning and natural language processing, to inform the algorithmic changes that ultimately improve a user’s search experience. Although these efforts have led to objective improvements in search quality, the technical underpinnings remain largely invisible and go largely unnoticed by most users. Here we describe how these ‘under-the-hood’ techniques work within PubMed and report how their effectiveness and usage is assessed in real-world scenarios. In doing so, we hope to increase the transparency of the PubMed system and enable users to make more effective use of the search engine. We also identify open challenges and new opportunities for computational researchers to explore the potential of future improvements. © 2018, Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

N2  - Context: Open source software (OSS) and software ecosystems (SECOs) are two consolidated research areas in software engineering. OSS influences the way organizations develop, acquire, use and commercialize software. SECOs have emerged as a paradigm to understand dynamics and heterogeneity in collaborative software development. For this reason, SECOs appear as a valid instrument to analyze OSS systems. However, there are few studies that blend both topics together. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of the art in OSS ecosystems (OSSECOs) research, specifically: (a) what the most relevant definitions related to OSSECOs are; (b) what the particularities of this type of SECO are; and (c) how the knowledge about OSSECO is represented. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping following recommended practices. We applied automatic and manual searches on different sources and used a rigorous method to elicit the keywords from the research questions and selection criteria to retrieve the final papers. As a result, 82 papers were selected and evaluated. Threats to validity were identified and mitigated whenever possible. Results: The analysis allowed us to answer the research questions. Most notably, we did the following: (a) identified 64 terms related to the OSSECO and arranged them into a taxonomy; (b) built a genealogical tree to understand the genesis of the OSSECO term from related definitions; (c) analyzed the available definitions of SECO in the context of OSS; and (d) classified the existing modelling and analysis techniques of OSSECOs. Conclusion: As a summary of the systematic mapping, we conclude that existing research on several topics related to OSSECOs is still scarce (e.g., modelling and analysis techniques, quality models, standard definitions, etc.). This situation calls for further investigation efforts on how organizations and OSS communities actually understand OSSECOs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Social media platforms are popular for expressing personal views, emotions and beliefs. Social media platforms are influential for propagating extremist ideologies for group-building, fund-raising, and recruitment. To monitor and control the outreach of extremists on social media, detection of extremism in social media is necessary. The existing extremism detection literature on social media is limited by specific ideology, subjective validation methods, and binary or tertiary classification. A comprehensive and comparative survey of datasets, classification techniques, validation methods with online extremism detection tool is essential. The systematic literature review methodology (PRISMA) was used. Sixty-four studies on extremism research were collected, including 31 from SCOPUS, Web of Science (WoS), ACM, IEEE, and 33 thesis, technical and analytical reports using Snowballing technique. The survey highlights the role of social media in propagating online radicalization and the need for extremism detection on social media platforms. The review concludes lack of publicly available, class-balanced, and unbiased datasets for better detection and classification of social-media extremism. Lack of validation techniques to evaluate correctness and quality of custom data sets without human interventions, was found. The information retrieval unveiled that contemporary research work is prejudiced towards ISIS ideology. We investigated that deep learning based automated extremism detection techniques outperform other techniques. The review opens the research opportunities for developing an online, publicly available automated tool for extremism data collection and detection. The survey results in conceptualization of architecture for construction of multi-ideology extremism text dataset with robust data validation techniques for multiclass classification of extremism text. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Introduction Experts agree that male involvement in maternal health is a multifaceted concept, but a robust assessment is lacking, hampering interpretation of the literature. This systematic review aims to examine the conceptualisation of male involvement in maternal health globally and review commonly used indicators. Methods PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL databases were searched for quantitative literature (between the years 2000 and 2020) containing indicators representing male involvement in maternal health, which was defined as the involvement, participation, engagement or support of men in all activities related to maternal health. Results After full-Text review, 282 studies were included in the review. Most studies were conducted in Africa (43%), followed by North America (23%), Asia (15%) and Europe (12%). Descriptive and text mining analysis showed male involvement has been conceptualised by focusing on two main aspects: psychosocial support and instrumental support for maternal health care utilisation. Differences in measurement and topics were noted according to continent with Africa focusing on HIV prevention, North America and Europe on psychosocial health and stress, and Asia on nutrition. One-Third of studies used one single indicator and no common pattern of indicators could be identified. Antenatal care attendance was the most used indicator (40%), followed by financial support (17%), presence during childbirth (17%) and HIV testing (14%). Majority of studies did not collect data from men directly. Discussion Researchers often focus on a single aspect of male involvement, resulting in a narrow set of indicators. Aspects such as communication, shared decision making and the subjective feeling of support have received little attention. We believe a broader holistic scope can broaden the potential of male involvement programmes and stimulate a gender-Transformative approach. Further research is recommended to develop a robust and comprehensive set of indicators for assessing male involvement in maternal health. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

N2  - Medical systematic reviews answer particular questions within a very specific domain of expertise by selecting and analysing the current pertinent literature. As part of this process, the phase of screening articles usually requires a long time and significant effort as it involves a group of domain experts evaluating thousands of articles in order to find the relevant instances. Our goal is to support this process through automatic tools. There is a recent trend of applying text classification methods to semi-automate the screening phase by providing decision support to the group of experts, hence helping reduce the required time and effort. In this work, we contribute to this line of work by performing a comprehensive set of text classification experiments on a corpus resulting from an actual systematic review in the area of Internet-Based Randomised Controlled Trials. These experiments involved applying multiple machine learning algorithms combined with several feature selection techniques to different parts of the articles (i.e., titles, abstract, or both). Results are generally positive in terms of overall precision and recall measurements, reaching values of up to 84%. It is also revealing in terms of how using only article titles provides virtually as good results as when adding article abstracts. Based on the positive results, it is clear that text classification can support the screening stage of medical systematic reviews. However, selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms, related methods, and text sections of articles is a neglected but important requirement because of its significant impact to the end results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Research question: What are the current research trends in human assisted reproduction around the world? Design: An analysis of 26,000+ scientific publications (articles, letters and reviews) produced worldwide between 2005 and 2016. The corpus of publications indexed in PubMed was obtained by combining the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms: ‘Reproductive techniques’, ‘Reproductive medicine’, ‘Reproductive health’, ‘Fertility’, ‘Infertility’ and ‘Germ cells’. An analysis was then carried out using text mining algorithms to obtain the main topics of interest. Results: A total of 44 main topics were identified, which were then further grouped into 11 categories: ‘Laboratory techniques’, ‘Male factor’, ‘Quality of ART, ethics and law’, ‘Female factor’, ‘Public health and infectious diseases’, ‘Basic research and genetics’, ‘Pregnancy complications and risks’, ‘General – infertility & ART’, ‘Psychosocial aspects’, ‘Cancer’ and ‘Research methodology’. The USA was the leading country in terms of number of publications, followed by the UK, China and France. Research content in high-income countries is fairly homogeneous across categories and it is dominated by ‘Laboratory techniques’ in Western-Southern Europe, and by ‘Quality of ART, ethics and law’ in North America, Australia and New Zealand. ‘Laboratory techniques’ is also the most abundant category on a yearly basis. Conclusions: This study identifies the current hot topics on human assisted reproduction worldwide and their temporal trends for 2005–2016. This provides an innovative picture of the current research that could help explore the areas where further research is needed. © 2019 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

N2  - Background: Web applications that employ natural language processing technologies to support systematic reviewers during abstract screening have become more common. The goal of our project was to conduct a case study to explore a screening approach that temporarily replaces a human screener with a semi-automated screening tool. Methods: We evaluated the accuracy of the approach using DistillerAI as a semi-automated screening tool. A published comparative effectiveness review served as the reference standard. Five teams of professional systematic reviewers screened the same 2472 abstracts in parallel. Each team trained DistillerAI with 300 randomly selected abstracts that the team screened dually. For all remaining abstracts, DistillerAI replaced one human screener and provided predictions about the relevance of records. A single reviewer also screened all remaining abstracts. A second human screener resolved conflicts between the single reviewer and DistillerAI. We compared the decisions of the machine-assisted approach, single-reviewer screening, and screening with DistillerAI alone against the reference standard. Results: The combined sensitivity of the machine-assisted screening approach across the five screening teams was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66 to 90%), and the combined specificity was 95% (95% CI, 92 to 97%). By comparison, the sensitivity of single-reviewer screening was similar (78%; 95% CI, 66 to 89%); however, the sensitivity of DistillerAI alone was substantially worse (14%; 95% CI, 0 to 31%) than that of the machine-assisted screening approach. Specificities for single-reviewer screening and DistillerAI were 94% (95% CI, 91 to 97%) and 98% (95% CI, 97 to 100%), respectively. Machine-assisted screening and single-reviewer screening had similar areas under the curve (0.87 and 0.86, respectively); by contrast, the area under the curve for DistillerAI alone was just slightly better than chance (0.56). The interrater agreement between human screeners and DistillerAI with a prevalence-adjusted kappa was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.86%). Conclusions: The accuracy of DistillerAI is not yet adequate to replace a human screener temporarily during abstract screening for systematic reviews. Rapid reviews, which do not require detecting the totality of the relevant evidence, may find semi-automation tools to have greater utility than traditional systematic reviews. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: We investigated the feasibility of using a machine learning tool's relevance predictions to expedite title and abstract screening. Methods: We subjected 11 systematic reviews and six rapid reviews to four retrospective screening simulations (automated and semi-automated approaches to single-reviewer and dual independent screening) in Abstrackr, a freely-available machine learning software. We calculated the proportion missed, workload savings, and time savings compared to single-reviewer and dual independent screening by human reviewers. We performed cited reference searches to determine if missed studies would be identified via reference list scanning. Results: For systematic reviews, the semi-automated, dual independent screening approach provided the best balance of time savings (median (range) 20 (3-82) hours) and reliability (median (range) proportion missed records, 1 (0-14)%). The cited references search identified 59% (n = 10/17) of the records missed. For the rapid reviews, the fully and semi-automated approaches saved time (median (range) 9 (2-18) hours and 3 (1-10) hours, respectively), but less so than for the systematic reviews. The median (range) proportion missed records for both approaches was 6 (0-22)%. Conclusion: Using Abstrackr to assist one of two reviewers in systematic reviews saves time with little risk of missing relevant records. Many missed records would be identified via other means. © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: We explored the performance of three machine learning tools designed to facilitate title and abstract screening in systematic reviews (SRs) when used to (a) eliminate irrelevant records (automated simulation) and (b) complement the work of a single reviewer (semi-automated simulation). We evaluated user experiences for each tool. Methods: We subjected three SRs to two retrospective screening simulations. In each tool (Abstrackr, DistillerSR, RobotAnalyst), we screened a 200-record training set and downloaded the predicted relevance of the remaining records. We calculated the proportion missed and workload and time savings compared to dual independent screening. To test user experiences, eight research staff tried each tool and completed a survey. Results: Using Abstrackr, DistillerSR, and RobotAnalyst, respectively, the median (range) proportion missed was 5 (0 to 28) percent, 97 (96 to 100) percent, and 70 (23 to 100) percent for the automated simulation and 1 (0 to 2) percent, 2 (0 to 7) percent, and 2 (0 to 4) percent for the semi-automated simulation. The median (range) workload savings was 90 (82 to 93) percent, 99 (98 to 99) percent, and 85 (85 to 88) percent for the automated simulation and 40 (32 to 43) percent, 49 (48 to 49) percent, and 35 (34 to 38) percent for the semi-automated simulation. The median (range) time savings was 154 (91 to 183), 185 (95 to 201), and 157 (86 to 172) hours for the automated simulation and 61 (42 to 82), 92 (46 to 100), and 64 (37 to 71) hours for the semi-automated simulation. Abstrackr identified 33-90% of records missed by a single reviewer. RobotAnalyst performed less well and DistillerSR provided no relative advantage. User experiences depended on user friendliness, qualities of the user interface, features and functions, trustworthiness, ease and speed of obtaining predictions, and practicality of the export file(s). Conclusions: The workload savings afforded in the automated simulation came with increased risk of missing relevant records. Supplementing a single reviewer's decisions with relevance predictions (semi-automated simulation) sometimes reduced the proportion missed, but performance varied by tool and SR. Designing tools based on reviewers' self-identified preferences may improve their compatibility with present workflows. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Machine learning tools can expedite systematic review (SR) processes by semi-automating citation screening. Abstrackr semi-automates citation screening by predicting relevant records. We evaluated its performance for four screening projects. Methods: We used a convenience sample of screening projects completed at the Alberta Research Centre for Health Evidence, Edmonton, Canada: three SRs and one descriptive analysis for which we had used SR screening methods. The projects were heterogeneous with respect to search yield (median 9328; range 5243 to 47,385 records; interquartile range (IQR) 15,688 records), topic (Antipsychotics, Bronchiolitis, Diabetes, Child Health SRs), and screening complexity. We uploaded the records to Abstrackr and screened until it made predictions about the relevance of the remaining records. Across three trials for each project, we compared the predictions to human reviewer decisions and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, precision, false negative rate, proportion missed, and workload savings. Results: Abstrackr's sensitivity was >0.75 for all projects and the mean specificity ranged from 0.69 to 0.90 with the exception of Child Health SRs, for which it was 0.19. The precision (proportion of records correctly predicted as relevant) varied by screening task (median 26.6%; range 14.8 to 64.7%; IQR 29.7%). The median false negative rate (proportion of records incorrectly predicted as irrelevant) was 12.6% (range 3.5 to 21.2%; IQR 12.3%). The workload savings were often large (median 67.2%, range 9.5 to 88.4%; IQR 23.9%). The proportion missed (proportion of records predicted as irrelevant that were included in the final report, out of the total number predicted as irrelevant) was 0.1% for all SRs and 6.4% for the descriptive analysis. This equated to 4.2% (range 0 to 12.2%; IQR 7.8%) of the records in the final reports. Conclusions: Abstrackr's reliability and the workload savings varied by screening task. Workload savings came at the expense of potentially missing relevant records. How this might affect the results and conclusions of SRs needs to be evaluated. Studies evaluating Abstrackr as the second reviewer in a pair would be of interest to determine if concerns for reliability would diminish. Further evaluations of Abstrackr's performance and usability will inform its refinement and practical utility. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the reliability of RobotReviewer's risk of bias judgments. Study Design and Setting: In this prospective cross-sectional evaluation, we used RobotReviewer to assess risk of bias among 1,180 trials. We computed reliability with human reviewers using Cohen's kappa coefficient and calculated sensitivity and specificity. We investigated differences in reliability by risk of bias domain, topic, and outcome type using the chi-square test in meta-analysis. Results: Reliability (95% CI) was moderate for random sequence generation (0.48 [0.43, 0.53]), allocation concealment (0.45 [0.40, 0.51]), and blinding of participants and personnel (0.42 [0.36, 0.47]); fair for overall risk of bias (0.34 [0.25, 0.44]); and slight for blinding of outcome assessors (0.10 [0.06, 0.14]), incomplete outcome data (0.14 [0.08, 0.19]), and selective reporting (0.02 [−0.02, 0.05]). Reliability for blinding of participants and personnel (P < 0.001), blinding of outcome assessors (P = 0.005), selective reporting (P < 0.001), and overall risk of bias (P < 0.001) differed by topic. Sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) ranged from 0.20 (0.18, 0.23) to 0.76 (0.72, 0.80) and from 0.61 (0.56, 0.65) to 0.95 (0.93, 0.96), respectively. Conclusion: Risk of bias appraisal is subjective. Compared with reliability between author groups, RobotReviewer's reliability with human reviewers was similar for most domains and better for allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, and overall risk of bias. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - We provide a comprehensive structuring of research on Islamic economics and finance into the core topics of the area, for the period 1979 to 2018. This is carried out through a probabilistic topic modeling approach that allows statistical learning of the connection between research articles as well as their shared topics. This approach, which blends machine learning and natural language processing, helps provide a comprehensive structure to the literature. Our topic modeling analysis is conducted on approximately 1500 articles, and suggests the Islamic economics and finance literature can be well-described by 11 topics. These topics cover economic, finance, and morality issues. Our research can be applied to provide a clear structure for ongoing research agendas in Islamic economics and finance as well as a framework for understanding research development in this area. We also note the differences between Islamic and conventional approaches to economics and finance research in order to highlight the inherent new contributions of this maturing area of research. © 2021 The Author(s)

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of validated and updated scientific information to help policy makers, healthcare professionals, and the public. The speed in disseminating reliable information and the subsequent guidelines and policy implementation are also essential to save as many lives as possible. Trustworthy guidelines should be based on a systematic evidence review which uses reproducible analytical methods to collect secondary data and analyse them. However, the guidelines’ drafting process is time consuming and requires a great deal of resources. This paper aims to highlight the importance of accelerating and streamlining the extraction and synthesis of scientific evidence, specifically within the systematic review process. To do so, this paper describes the COKE (COVID-19 Knowledge Extraction framework for next generation discovery science) Project, which involves the use of machine reading and deep learning to design and implement a semi-automated system that supports and enhances the systematic literature review and guideline drafting processes. Specifically, we propose a framework for aiding in the literature selection and navigation process that employs natural language processing and clustering techniques for selecting and organizing the literature for human consultation, according to PICO (Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) elements. We show some preliminary results of the automatic classification of sentences on a dataset of abstracts related to COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Systematic review, meta-analysis and other forms of evidence synthesis are critical to strengthen the evidence base concerning conservation issues and to answer ecological and evolutionary questions. Synthesis lags behind the pace of scientific publishing, however, due to time and resource costs which partial automation of evidence synthesis tasks could reduce. Additionally, current methods of retrieving evidence for synthesis are susceptible to bias towards studies with which researchers are familiar. In fields that lack standardized terminology encoded in an ontology, including ecology and evolution, research teams can unintentionally exclude articles from the review by omitting synonymous phrases in their search terms. To combat these problems, we developed a quick, objective, reproducible method for generating search strategies that uses text mining and keyword co-occurrence networks to identify the most important terms for a review. The method reduces bias in search strategy development because it does not rely on a predetermined set of articles and can improve search recall by identifying synonymous terms that research teams might otherwise omit. When tested against the search strategies used in published environmental systematic reviews, our method performs as well as the published searches and retrieves gold-standard hits that replicated versions of the original searches do not. Because the method is quasi-automated, the amount of time required to develop a search strategy, conduct searches, and assemble results is reduced from approximately 17–34 hr to under 2 hr. To facilitate use of the method for environmental evidence synthesis, we implemented the method in the R package litsearchr, which also contains a suite of functions to improve efficiency of systematic reviews by automatically deduplicating and assembling results from separate databases. © 2019 The Authors.

N2  - Cause-related marketing (C-RM) has risen to become a popular strategy to increase business value through profit-motivated giving. Despite the growing number of articles published in the last decade, no comprehensive analysis of the most discussed constructs of cause-related marketing is available. This paper uses an advanced Text Mining methodology (a Bayesian contextual analysis algorithm known as Correlated Topic Model, CTM) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of 246 articles published in 40 different journals between 1988 and 2013 on the subject of cause-related marketing. Text Mining also allows quantitative analyses to be performed on the literature. For instance, it is shown that the most prominent long-term topics discussed since 1988 on the subject are “brand-cause fit”, “law and Ethics”, and “corporate and social identification”, while the most actively discussed topic presently is “sectors raising social taboos and moral debates”. The paper has two goals: first, it introduces the technique of CTM to the Marketing area, illustrating how Text Mining may guide, simplify, and enhance review processes while providing objective building blocks (topics) to be used in a review; second, it applies CTM to the C-RM field, uncovering and summarizing the most discussed topics. Mining text, however, is not aimed at replacing all subjective decisions that must be taken as part of literature review methodologies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

N2  - Purpose: Text summarization of clinical trial descriptions has the potential to reduce the time required to familiarize oneself with the subject of studies by condensing long-form detailed descriptions to concise, meaning-preserving synopses. This work describes the process and quality of automatically generated summaries of clinical trial descriptions using extractive text summarization methods. Methods: We generated a novel dataset from the detailed descriptions and brief summaries of trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov. We executed several text summarization algorithms on the detailed descriptions in this corpus and calculated the standard ROUGE metrics using the brief summaries included in the record as a reference. To investigate the correlation of these metrics with human sentiments, four reviewers assessed the content-completeness of the generated summaries and the helpfulness of both the generated and reference summaries via a Likert scale questionnaire. Results: The filtering stages of the dataset generation process reduce the 277,228 trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov to 101,016 records usable for the summarization task. On average, the summaries in this corpus are 25% the length of the detailed descriptions. Of the evaluated text summarization methods, the TextRank algorithm exhibits the overall best performance with a ROUGE-1 F1 score of 0.3531, ROUGE-2 F1 score of 0.1723, and ROUGE-L F1 score of 0.3003. These scores correlate with the assessment of the helpfulness and content similarity by the human reviewers. Inter-rater agreement for the helpfulness and content similarity was slight and fair respectively (Fleiss’ kappa of 0.12 and 0.22). Conclusions: Extractive summarization is a viable tool for generating meaning-preserving synopses of detailed clinical trial descriptions. Further, the human evaluation has shown that the ROUGE-L F1 score is useful for rating the general quality of generated summaries of clinical trial descriptions in an automated way. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The booming construction industry has led to many environmental and occupational health and safety problems. Construction dust caused irreversible damage to the health of frontline workers and polluted the surrounding air environment, which has attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners. In this study, to systematically sort and analyze the distribution of construction dust (CD) research, its hot areas, and the evolution of its fronts, papers with “construction dust” as the subject term in the Web of Science Core Collection Database since 2010 are visually analyzed using CiteSpace. The characteristics of these papers, including the quantity trend, quality, author group, affiliated institution type, and journal type, are summarized, and keyword co-appearance and paper co-citation knowledge maps are produced. The results show that (1) China is the backbone of CD research, and the research results account for a considerable proportion of the total. (2) Respiratory dust and atmospheric aerosols, marble dust, PM2.5, and other hot issues have always attracted international attention. And exposure assessment and spatial distribution were the main focuses in the study of CD. (3) The direction of CD research will explore in a more subtle and intelligent direction in the future, for example, monitoring and control equipment under the technical support of big data technology and machine learning and face recognition. By combining bibliometrics with a systematic review, we aim to analyze the research foci and future development direction deeply, providing scholars with a comprehensive view of the field. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - One of the most important steps in the process of conducting a systematic review or map is data extraction and the production of a database of coding, metadata and study data. There are many ways to structure these data, but to date, no guidelines or standards have been produced for the evidence synthesis community to support their production. Furthermore, there is little adoption of easily machine-readable, readily reusable and adaptable databases: these databases would be easier to translate into different formats by review authors, for example for tabulation, visualisation and analysis, and also by readers of the review/map. As a result, it is common for systematic review and map authors to produce bespoke, complex data structures that, although typically provided digitally, require considerable efforts to understand, verify and reuse. Here, we report on an analysis of systematic reviews and maps published by the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, and discuss major issues that hamper machine readability and data reuse or verification. We highlight different justifications for the alternative data formats found: condensed databases; long databases; and wide databases. We describe these challenges in the context of data science principles that can support curation and publication of machine-readable, Open Data. We then go on to make recommendations to review and map authors on how to plan and structure their data, and we provide a suite of novel R-based functions to support efficient and reliable translation of databases between formats that are useful for presentation (condensed, human readable tables), filtering and visualisation (wide databases), and analysis (long databases). We hope that our recommendations for adoption of standard practices in database formatting, and the tools necessary to rapidly move between formats will provide a step-change in transparency and replicability of Open Data in evidence synthesis. © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. However, systematic reviews are time consuming and there is growing demand to produce evidence more quickly, while maintaining robust methods. In recent years, artificial intelligence and active-machine learning (AML) have been implemented into several SR software applications. As some of the barriers to adoption of new technologies are the challenges in set-up and how best to use these technologies, we have provided different situations and considerations for knowledge synthesis teams to consider when using artificial intelligence and AML for title and abstract screening. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the implementation and performance of AML across a set of ten historically completed systematic reviews. Based upon the findings from this work and in consideration of the barriers we have encountered and navigated during the past 24 months in using these tools prospectively in our research, we discussed and developed a series of practical recommendations for research teams to consider in seeking to implement AML tools for citation screening into their workflow. Results: We developed a seven-step framework and provide guidance for when and how to integrate artificial intelligence and AML into the title and abstract screening process. Steps include: (1) Consulting with Knowledge user/Expert Panel; (2) Developing the search strategy; (3) Preparing your review team; (4) Preparing your database; (5) Building the initial training set; (6) Ongoing screening; and (7) Truncating screening. During Step 6 and/or 7, you may also choose to optimize your team, by shifting some members to other review stages (e.g., full-text screening, data extraction). Conclusion: Artificial intelligence and, more specifically, AML are well-developed tools for title and abstract screening and can be integrated into the screening process in several ways. Regardless of the method chosen, transparent reporting of these methods is critical for future studies evaluating artificial intelligence and AML. © 2021, The Author(s).

Active learning text classification is a supervised machine learning approach that has been shown to significantly reduce the manual annotation workload by semi-automating the citation screening process of systematic reviews. In this paper, we present a new topic detection method that induces an informative representation of studies, to improve the performance of the underlying active learner. Our proposed topic detection method uses a neural network-based vector space model to capture semantic similarities between documents. We firstly represent documents within the vector space, and cluster the documents into a predefined number of clusters. The centroids of the clusters are treated as latent topics. We then represent each document as a mixture of latent topics. For evaluation purposes, we employ the active learning strategy using both our novel topic detection method and a baseline topic model (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Results obtained demonstrate that our method is able to achieve a high sensitivity of eligible studies and a significantly reduced manual annotation cost when compared to the baseline method. This observation is consistent across two clinical and three public health reviews. The tool introduced in this work is available from https://nactem.ac.uk/pvtopic/. © 2016 The Authors.

N2  - Background Different approaches can be adopted for the development of search strategies of systematic reviews. The objective approach draws on already established text analysis methods for developing search filters. Our aim was to determine whether the objective approach for the development of search strategies was noninferior to the conceptual approach commonly used in Cochrane reviews (CRs). Methods We conducted a search for CRs published in the Cochrane Library. The studies included in the CRs were searched for in MEDLINE and represented the total set. We then tested whether references previously removed could be identified via the objective approach. We also reconstructed the original search strategies from the CRs to determine why references could not be identified by the objective approach. As we performed the validation of the search strategies without study filters, we used only sensitivity as a quality measure and did not calculate precision. Results The objective approach yielded a mean sensitivity of 96% based on 13 searches. The noninferiority test showed that this approach was noninferior to the conceptual approach used in the CRs (P < 0.002). An additional descriptive analysis showed that the original MEDLINE strategies could identify only 86% of all references; however, this lower sensitivity was largely due to one CR. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, our findings indicate for the first time that the objective approach for the development of search strategies is noninferior to the conceptual approach. © 2015 The Authors.

N2  - Background In the development of search strategies for systematic reviews, “conceptual approaches” are generally recommended to identify appropriate search terms for those parts of the strategies for which no validated search filters exist. However, “objective approaches” based on search terms identified by text analysis are increasingly being applied. Objectives To prospectively compare an objective with a conceptual approach for the development of search strategies. Methods Two different MEDLINE search strategies were developed in parallel for five systematic reviews covering a range of topics and study designs. The Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) applied an objective approach, and external experts applied a conceptual approach for the same research questions. For each systematic review, the citations retrieved were combined and the overall pool of citations screened to determine sensitivity and precision. Results The objective approach yielded a weighted mean sensitivity and precision of 97% and 5%. The corresponding values for the conceptual approach were 75% and 4%. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the objective approach applied by IQWiG for search strategy development yields higher sensitivity than and similar precision to a conceptual approach. The main advantage of the objective approach is that it produces consistent results across searches. © 2016 The Author(s)

N2  - Purpose: RobotReviewer is a machine learning system for semi-automated assistance in risk of bias assessment. The tools’s performance in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the field of nursing remains unknown. We aimed therefore to evaluate the agreement in risk of bias assessment between RobotReviewer and human reviewers. Design: Evaluation study using a retrospective diagnostic design. Methods: We used RobotReviewer as the index test and human reviewers’ risk of bias assessment reported in Cochrane reviews as the reference test. A convenience sample of electronically available English-language full texts of RCTs included in Cochrane reviews with nurs* in the title were eligible for inclusion. In this context, we assessed random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding (personnel or participants and assessors) corresponding to Cochrane risk of bias version 2011. Two independent research teams performed and double-checked data extraction and analysis. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the ROC curve, predictive values, observed percentage of agreement, and Cohen’s kappa (including confidence intervals, if applicable). Findings: The selection process yielded 190 RCTs published between 1958 and 2016 in 23 Cochrane reviews published between 2000 and 2018. Missing assessments of risk of bias domains in Cochrane reviews or RobotReviewer yielded varying sample sizes per risk of bias domain. Sensitivity ranged from 0.44 to 0.88 and specificity from 0.48 to 0.95. Positive predictive value was highest for allocation concealment (0.79) and lowest for blinding assessors (0.25). Cohen’s kappa was moderate for randomization (0.52), allocation concealment (0.60), and for blinding of personnel/patients (0.43). Blinding of outcome assessors had only slight agreement (0.04). Conclusions: This is the first evaluation of risk of bias assessment by RobotReviewer in RCTs included in nursing-related Cochrane reviews. It yielded a moderate degree of agreement with human reviewers for randomization and allocation concealment, and an adequate sensitivity for detecting low risk of selection bias. Clinical Relevance: Based on our results, using the RobotReviewer for risk of bias assessment in RCTs can be supportive in some risk of bias domains. However, human reviewers should supervise the semi-automated assessment process. © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Thanks to the many chemical and nutritional components it carries, diet critically affects human health. However, the currently available comprehensive databases on food composition cover only a tiny fraction of the total number of chemicals present in our food, focusing on the nutritional components essential for our health. Indeed, thousands of other molecules, many of which have well documented health implications, remain untracked. To explore the body of knowledge available on food composition, we built FoodMine, an algorithm that uses natural language processing to identify papers from PubMed that potentially report on the chemical composition of garlic and cocoa. After extracting from each paper information on the reported quantities of chemicals, we find that the scientific literature carries extensive information on the detailed chemical components of food that is currently not integrated in databases. Finally, we use unsupervised machine learning to create chemical embeddings, finding that the chemicals identified by FoodMine tend to have direct health relevance, reflecting the scientific community’s focus on health-related chemicals in our food. © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - The increasing interconnection of machines in industrial production on one hand, and the improved capabilities to store, retrieve, and analyze large amounts of data on the other, offer promising perspectives for maintaining production machines. Recently, predictive maintenance has gained increasing attention in the context of equipment maintenance systems. As opposed to other approaches, predictive maintenance relies on machine behavior models, which offer several advantages. In this highly interdisciplinary field, there is a lack of a literature review of relevant research fields and realization techniques. To obtain a comprehensive overview on the state of the art, large data sets of relevant literature need to be considered and, best case, be automatically partitioned into relevant research fields. A proper methodology to obtain such an overview is the bibliometric analysis method. In the presented work, we apply a bibliometric analysis to the field of equipment maintenance systems. To be more precise, we analyzed clusters of identified literature with the goal to obtain deeper insight into the related research fields. Moreover, cluster metrics reveal the importance of a single paper and an investigation of the temporal cluster development indicates the evolution of research topics. In this context, we introduce a new measure to compare results from different time periods in an appropriate way. In turn, among others, this simplifies the analysis of topics, with a vast amount of subtopics. Altogether, the obtained results particularly provide a comprehensive overview of established techniques and emerging trends for equipment maintenance systems. © 2018 by the authors.

N2  - Proactive traffic safety management systems can monitor traffic conditions in real-time, identify the formation of unsafe traffic dynamics, and implement suitable interventions to bring unsafe conditions back to normal traffic situations. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, sensor fusion and algorithms have brought about the introduction of a proactive safety management system closer to reality. The basic prerequisite for developing such a system is to have a reliable crash prediction model that takes real-time traffic data as input and evaluates their association with crash risk. Since the early 21st century, several studies have focused on developing such models. Although the idea has considerably matured over time, the endeavours have been quite discrete and fragmented at best because the fundamental aspects of the overall modelling approach substantially vary. Therefore, a number of transitional challenges have to be identified and subsequently addressed before a ubiquitous proactive safety management system can be formulated, designed and implemented in real-world scenarios. This manuscript conducts a comprehensive review of existing real-time crash prediction models with the aim of illustrating the state-of-the-art and systematically synthesizing the thoughts presented in existing studies in order to facilitate its translation from an idea into a ready to use technology. Towards that journey, it conducts a systematic review by applying various text mining methods and topic modelling. Based on the findings, this paper ascertains the development pathways followed in various studies, formulates the ubiquitous design requirements of such models from existing studies and knowledge of similar systems. Finally, this study evaluates the universality and design compatibility of existing models. This paper is, therefore, expected to serve as a one stop knowledge source for facilitating a faster transition from the idea of real-time crash prediction models to a real-world operational proactive traffic safety management system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Safety is an essential topic to the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. However, traditional methods for structural health monitoring (SHM) and jobsite safety management (JSM) are not only inefficient, but also costly. In the past decade, scholars have developed a wide range of deep learning (DL) applications to address automated structure inspection and onsite safety monitoring, such as the identification of structural defects, deterioration patterns, unsafe workforce behaviors and latent risk factors. Although numerous studies have examined the effectiveness of the DL methodology, there has not been one comprehensive, systematic, evidence-based review of all individual articles that investigate the effectiveness of using DL in the SHM and JSM industry to date, nor has there been an examination of this body of evidence in regard to these methodological problems. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to disclose the state of the art of current research progress and determine the relevant gaps, challenges and future work. Methodically, CiteSpace was employed to summarize the research trends, advancements and frontiers of DL applications from 2010 to 2020. Next, an application-focused literature review was conducted, which led to a summary of research gaps, recommendations and future research directions. Overall, this review gains insight into SHM and JSM and aims to help researchers formulate more types of effective DL applications which have not been addressed sufficiently for the time being. © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Finding relevant articles in large bibliographic databases such as PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and EMBASE to inform care and future research is challenging. Articles relevant to chronic kidney disease (CKD) are particularly difficult to find because they are often published under different terminology and are found across a wide range of journal types. Study Design: We used computer automation within a diagnostic test assessment framework to develop and validate information search filters to identify CKD articles in large bibliographic databases. Setting & Participants: 22,992 full-text articles in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, or EMBASE. Index Test: 1,374,148 unique search filters. Reference Test: We established the reference standard of article relevance to CKD by manual review of all full-text articles using prespecified criteria to determine whether each article contained CKD content or not. We then assessed filter performance by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for the retrieval of CKD articles. Filters with high sensitivity and specificity for the identification of CKD articles in the development phase (two-thirds of the sample) were then retested in the validation phase (remaining one-third of the sample). Results: We developed and validated high-performance CKD search filters for each bibliographic database. Filters optimized for sensitivity reached at least 99% sensitivity, and filters optimized for specificity reached at least 97% specificity. The filters were complex; for example, one PubMed filter included more than 89 terms used in combination, including "chronic kidney disease," "renal insufficiency," and "renal fibrosis." In proof-ofconcept searches, physicians found more articles relevant to the topic of CKD with the use of these filters. Limitations: As knowledge of the pathogenesis of CKD grows and definitions change, these filters will need to be updated to incorporate new terminology used to index relevant articles. Conclusions: PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and EMBASE can be filtered reliably for articles relevant to CKD. These high-performance information filters are now available online and can be used to better identify CKD content in large bibliographic databases. © 2014 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

N2  - Clustering is a branch of data mining which involves grouping similar data in a collection known as cluster. Clustering can be used in many fields, one of the important applications is the intelligent text clustering. Text clustering in traditional algorithms was collecting documents based on keyword matching, this means that the documents were clustered without having any descriptive notions. Hence, non-similar documents were collected in the same cluster. The key solution for this problem is to cluster documents based on semantic similarity, where the documents are clustered based on the meaning and not keywords. In this research, fifty papers which use semantic similarity in different fields have been reviewed, thirteen of them that are using semantic similarity based on document clustering in five recent years have been selected for a deep study. A comprehensive literature review for all the selected papers is stated. A comparison regarding their algorithms, used tools, and evaluation methods is given. Finally, an intensive discussion comparing the works is presented. © 2019 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction. Taxonomy is an effective mean of managing and accessing a large amount of digital information. Various techniques have been developed to generate taxonomy automatically. The purpose of this study is threefold:(i) review methods and approaches adopted during taxonomy generation, (ii) identify the factors influencing the choice of a particular method or approach, (iii) highlight issues and open challenges. Method. This paper adopts a systematic literature review approach proposed by Kitchenham, and the nature of this review is qualitative. Analysis. A total of thirty techniques were reviewed and categorized into various categories and subcategories. An in-depth analysis of the existing techniques was performed based on this categorization. This ultimately helps in identifying factors influencing the choice of a particular method or approach, and also determines issues and challenges associated with the automatic taxonomy generation. Results. Four major factors influencing the choice of a particular method or approach for generating taxonomy have been identified. Moreover, five major challenges associated with the existing automatic taxonomy generation techniques have also been highlighted. Conclusions. This paper presents a comprehensive review of taxonomy generation so that taxonomy can be used effectively, and it highlights open challenges for future research in the area of taxonomy generation so that new and improved techniques can be developed. © the authors, 2019.

N2  - Even though many genetic risk loci for human diseases have been identified and comprehensively cataloged, strategies to guide clinical research by integrating the extensive results of genetic studies and biological resources are still limited. Moreover, integrative analyses that provide novel insights into disease biology are expected to be especially useful for drug discovery. Herein, we used text mining of genetic studies on colorectal cancer (CRC) and assigned biological annotations to identified risk genes in order to discover novel drug targets and potential drugs for repurposing. Risk genes for CRC were obtained from PubMed text mining, and for each gene, six functional and bioinformatic annotations were analyzed. The annotations include missense mutations, cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL), molecular pathway analyses, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), a genetic overlap with knockout mouse phenotypes, and primary immunodeficiency (PID). We then prioritized the biological risk candidate genes according to a scoring system of the six functional annotations. Each functional annotation was assigned one point, and those genes with a score ≥2 were designated “biological CRC risk genes”. Using this method, we revealed 82 biological CRC risk genes, which were mapped to 128 genes in an expanded PPI network. Further utilizing DrugBank and the Therapeutic Target Database, we found 21 genes in our list that are targeted by 166 candidate drugs. Based on data from ClinicalTrials.gov and literature review, we found four known target genes with six drugs for clinical treatment in CRC, and three target genes with nine drugs supported by previous preclinical results in CRC. Additionally, 12 genes are targeted by 32 drugs approved for other indications, which can possibly be repurposed for CRC treatment. Finally, analysis from Connectivity Map (CMap) showed that 18 drugs have a high potential for CRC. © 2020 The Authors

N2  - Augmented reality has recently achieved a rapid growth through its applications in various industries, including education and entertainment. Despite the growing attraction of augmented reality, trend analyses in this emerging technology have relied on qualitative literature review, failing to provide comprehensive competitive intelligence analysis using objective data. Therefore, tracing industrial competition trends in augmented reality will provide technology experts with a better understanding of evolving competition trends and insights for further technology and sustainable business planning. In this paper, we apply a topic modeling approach to 3595 patents related to augmented reality technology to identify technology subjects and their knowledge stocks, thereby analyzing industrial competitive intelligence in light of technology subject and firm levels. As a result, we were able to obtain some findings from an inventional viewpoint: technological development of augmented reality will soon enter a mature stage, technologies of infrastructural requirements have been a focal subject since 2001, and several software firms and camera manufacturing firms have dominated the recent development of augmented reality. © 2017 by the authors.

N2  - Automated classification of text into predefined categories has always been considered as a vital method to manage and process a vast amount of documents in digital forms that are widespread and continuously increasing. This kind of web information, popularly known as the digital/electronic information is in the form of documents, conference material, publications, journals, editorials, web pages, e-mail etc. People largely access information from these online sources rather than being limited to archaic paper sources like books, magazines, newspapers etc. But the main problem is that this enormous information lacks organization which makes it difficult to manage. Text classification is recognized as one of the key techniques used for organizing such kind of digital data. In this paper we have studied the existing work in the area of text classification which will allow us to have a fair evaluation of the progress made in this field till date. We have investigated the papers to the best of our knowledge and have tried to summarize all existing information in a comprehensive and succinct manner. The studies have been summarized in a tabular form according to the publication year considering numerous key perspectives. The main emphasis is laid on various steps involved in text classification process viz. document representation methods, feature selection methods, data mining methods and the evaluation technique used by each study to carry out the results on a particular dataset. © 2015 Rajni Jindal, Ruchika Malhotra, and Abha Jain.

N2  - Over the last 20 years, and particularly with the advent of Big Data and analytics, the research area around Data and Information Quality (DIQ) is still a fast growing research area. There are many views and streams in DIQ research, generally aiming at improving the effectiveness of decision making in organizations. Although there are a lot of researches aimed at clarifying the role of BIG data quality for organizations, there is no comprehensive literature review that shows the main differences between traditional data quality researches and Big Data quality researches. This paper analyzed the papers published in Big data quality and find out that there is almost no new mainstream about Big Data quality. It is shown in this paper that the main concepts of data quality does not changes in Big Data context and that only some new issues have been added to this area. © University of Tehran, Faculty of Management

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the knowledge gaps in the published research on terrorism-related risk in supply chains, and to develop a framework of strategies and effective decision-making to enable practitioners to address terrorism-related risks in supply chain risk management (SCRM) and security. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a novel combination of triangulated methods comprising a systematic literature review (SLR), text mining and network analysis. These methods have not been jointly utilized in past studies, and the approach constitutes a rigorous methodology that cross-validates results and ensures the reliability and validity of qualitative data. Findings: The study reveals a number of key themes in the field of SCRM and security linked with terrorism. The authors identify relevant mitigation strategies and practices for effective strategic decision making. This subsequently leads us to develop a strategic framework of strategies and effective decision-making practices to address terrorism-related risk, affecting SCRM and security. The authors also identify key knowledge gaps in the literature and explore the main contributions by disciplines (e.g. business schools, engineering and maritime institutions) and countries. Practical implications: The authors provide a strategic framework of strategies and effective decision-making practices that managers can use to minimize terrorism-related risk in the context of SCRM and security. Originality/value: This paper introduces a novel methodological combination for improving the quality of SLRs. It uses the approach to systematically review the strategies and effective decision-making practices interlinked with terrorism risk, affecting SCRM and security. It identifies significant knowledge gaps and defines directions for future research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Despite the importance of evaluating all mitigation options to inform policy decisions addressing climate change, a comprehensive analysis of household-scale interventions and their emissions reduction potential is missing. Here, we address this gap for interventions aimed at changing individual households’ use of existing equipment, such as monetary incentives or feedback. We have performed a machine learning-assisted systematic review and meta-analysis to comparatively assess the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing energy demand in residential buildings. We extracted 360 individual effect sizes from 122 studies representing trials in 25 countries. Our meta-regression confirms that both monetary and non-monetary interventions reduce the energy consumption of households, but monetary incentives, of the sizes reported in the literature, tend to show on average a more pronounced effect. Deploying the right combinations of interventions increases the overall effectiveness. We have estimated a global carbon emissions reduction potential of 0.35 GtCO2 yr−1, although deploying the most effective packages of interventions could result in greater reduction. While modest, this potential should be viewed in conjunction with the need for de-risking mitigation pathways with energy-demand reductions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - In the literature, city logistics in terms of last mile delivery on the e-commerce market is quite new area of research that is not thoroughly investigated. It can be observed that there are many papers discussing various topics from the perspective of different groups of stakeholders such as residents, governments, shippers, receivers, transport companies (CEP), and others. However, there is no holistic approach covering the presented field of research. Therefore, the paper's purpose is identification of trends in sustainable last mile delivery on e-commerce market in cities from the perspective of various stakeholders. The research method that serves the paper's purpose is systematic literature review in the above-presented field performed through traditional method and machine learning (VOSviewer). In order to conduct critical analysis of published sources, the Web of Science and Scopus databases were applied. The paper's added value is a comprehensive approach to sustainable city logistics of last mile delivery that includes all stakeholders' perspectives and the identification of trends in this area. During the critical literature analysis, authors identified the relations between stakeholders, the fields of the research, and the trends for developing sustainable last mile delivery on the e-commerce market. It should be noted, that recent articles discuss newer technological and organization solutions, such as IoT, autonomous vehicles, crowd-shipping, parcel lockers, and concentrate on the behavior analysis of e-customers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Objective: To automatically recognize self-acknowledged limitations in clinical research publications to support efforts in improving research transparency. Methods: To develop our recognition methods, we used a set of 8431 sentences from 1197 PubMed Central articles. A subset of these sentences was manually annotated for training/testing, and inter-annotator agreement was calculated. We cast the recognition problem as a binary classification task, in which we determine whether a given sentence from a publication discusses self-acknowledged limitations or not. We experimented with three methods: A rule-based approach based on document structure, supervised machine learning, and a semi-supervised method that uses self-training to expand the training set in order to improve classification performance. The machine learning algorithms used were logistic regression (LR) and support vector machines (SVM). Results: Annotators had good agreement in labeling limitation sentences (Krippendorff's α= 0.781). Of the three methods used, the rule-based method yielded the best performance with 91.5% accuracy (95% CI [90.1-92.9]), while self-training with SVM led to a small improvement over fully supervised learning (89.9%, 95% CI [88.4-91.4] vs 89.6%, 95% CI [88.1-91.1]). Conclusions: The approach presented can be incorporated into the workflows of stakeholders focusing on research transparency to improve reporting of limitations in clinical studies. © 2018 American Medical Informatics Association.

N2  - Background: Social media platforms provide an easily accessible and time-saving communication approach for individuals with mental disorders compared to face-to-face meetings with medical providers. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based mental health exploration using large-scale social media data has attracted significant attention. Objective: We aimed to provide a bibliometric analysis and discussion on research trends of ML for mental health in social media. Methods: Publications addressing social media and ML in the field of mental health were retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. We analyzed the publication distribution to measure productivity on sources, countries, institutions, authors, and research subjects, and visualized the trends in this field using a keyword co-occurrence network. The research methodologies of previous studies with high citations are also thoroughly described. Results: We obtained a total of 565 relevant papers published from 2015 to 2020. In the last 5 years, the number of publications has demonstrated continuous growth with Lecture Notes in Computer Science and Journal of Medical Internet Research as the two most productive sources based on Scopus and Web of Science records. In addition, notable methodological approaches with data resources presented in high-ranking publications were investigated. Conclusions: The results of this study highlight continuous growth in this research area. Moreover, we retrieved three main discussion points from a comprehensive overview of highly cited publications that provide new in-depth directions for both researchers and practitioners. © Jina Kim, Daeun Lee, Eunil Park.

N2  - This study identified the trends in end-of-life care and nursing through text network analysis. About 18,935 articles published until September 2019 were selected through searches on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. For topic modeling, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (K = 8) was applied. Most of the top ranked topic words for the degree and betweenness centralities were consistent with the top 1% through the semantic network diagram. Among the important keywords examined every five years, “care” was unrivaled. When analyzing the two-and three-word combinations, there were many themes representing places, roles, and actions. As a result of performing topic modeling, eight topics were derived as ethical issues of decision-making for treatment withdrawal, symptom management to improve the quality of life, development of end-of-life knowledge education programs, life-sustaining care plan for elderly patients, home-based hospice, communication experience, patient symptom investigation, and an analysis of considering patient preferences. This study is meaningful as it analyzed a large amount of existing literature and considered the main trends of end-of-life care and nursing research based on the core subject control and semantic structure. © 2021 by the authors.

AU  - Klarin, A.

PD  - 
N2  - Research conducted in the innovation field lags behind organizations’ general technological development and innovativeness. Literature that previously depicted innovation types in developed markets is markedly different from progressively publicized emerging market innovation types. While capital-abundant firms tend to engage in respective pioneering and incremental innovation loops, resource-constrained firms and firms in emerging countries may partially free-ride on existing products and services through innovations such as copycat and frugal. To date, there have been no attempts to holistically consolidate product and service innovation types into one overarching typology. Using novel methods of text mining and co-citation analysis, this study systematically maps three decades of product and service innovation scholarship to provide a typology of eight major product and service innovation types. This is further supported by case study analysis to demonstrate how these innovation types fit into the cost vs market novelty matrix. This study is unique in its methodological proposition to systematically review the innovation scholarship of more than 1,400 articles through comprehensive, quantified, and objective methods that offer transparent and reproducible results. The study provides some clarity regarding the classifications and characteristics of the innovation typology. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Systematic reviews and systematic maps represent powerful tools to identify, collect, evaluate and summarise primary research pertinent to a specific research question or topic in a highly standardised and reproducible manner. Even though they are seen as the "gold standard" when synthesising primary research, systematic reviews and maps are typically resource-intensive and complex activities. Thus, managing the conduct and reporting of such reviews can become a time consuming and challenging task. This paper introduces the open access online tool CADIMA, which was developed through a collaboration between the Julius Kühn-Institut and the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, in order to increase the efficiency of the evidence synthesis process and facilitate reporting of all activities to maximise methodological rigour. Furthermore, we analyse how CADIMA compares with other available tools by providing a comprehensive summary of existing software designed for the purposes of systematic review management. We show that CADIMA is the only available open access tool that is designed to: (1) assist throughout the systematic review/map process; (2) be suited to reviews broader than medical sciences; (3) allow for offline data extraction; and, (4) support working as a review team. © 2018 The Author(s).

PD  - 
N2  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) incidence has been increasing steadily, most dramatically in the Western developed countries. Treatment often includes lifelong immunosuppressive therapy and surgery. There is a critical need to reduce the burden of IBD and to discover medical therapies with better efficacy and fewer potential side-effects. Repurposing of treatments originally studied in other diseases with similar pathogenesis is less costly and time intensive than de novo drug discovery. This study used a treatment repurposing methodology, the literature-related discovery and innovation (LRDI) text mining system, to identify potential treatments (developed for non-IBD diseases) with sufficient promise for extrapolation to treatment of IBD. By searching for desirable patterns of twenty key biomarkers relevant to IBD (e.g., inflammation, reactive oxygen species, autophagy, barrier function), the LRDI-based query retrieved approximately 9500 records from Medline. The most recent 350 records were further analyzed for proof-of-concept. Approximately 18% (64/350) met the criteria for discovery (not previously studied in IBD human or animal models) and relevance for application to IBD treatment. Many of the treatments were compounds derived from herbal remedies, and the majority of treatments were being studied in cancer, diabetes, and central nervous system disease, such as depression and dementia. As further validation of the search strategy, the query identified ten treatments that have just recently begun testing in IBD models in the last three years. Literature-related discovery and innovation text mining contains a unique search strategy with tremendous potential to identify treatments for repurposing. A more comprehensive query with additional key biomarkers would have retrieved many thousands more records, further increasing the yield of IBD treatment repurposing discovery. © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - System Dynamics celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2017. While there have been numerous special issues in diverse journals that bring together work by System Dynamics scholars who share similar research interests, there have been no systematic reviews of scholarly activity across the broad field. This paper presents a computational literature review of the field from 1974 to 2017. A CLR automates the analysis of research articles with analysis of content (topic modelling of abstracts) to identify emergent themes in the literature. We performed a broad review of the field by initially searching using the term “System Dynamics” with more than 8000 articles. However, the results obtained were not satisfactory so we decided to restrict our sample to less than 800 articles from recognised journals and proceedings. After evaluation of the results obtained from topic modelling, we decided to use 51 topics covering most of the articles in our sample. A list of 51 topics provides enough granularity to identify relevant patterns of activity within the community of System Dynamics scholars. For each of these 51 topics, we present a commentary on the key insights obtained. © 2018 Operational Research Society.

N2  - Objective: Research on publication trends in journal articles on sleep disorders (SDs) and the associated methodologies by using text mining has been limited. The present study involved text mining for terms to determine the publication trends in sleep-related journal articles published during 2000-2013 and to identify associations between SD and methodology terms as well as conducting statistical analyses of the text mining findings. Methods: SD and methodology terms were extracted from 3,720 sleep-related journal articles in the PubMed database by using MetaMap. The extracted data set was analyzed using hierarchical cluster analyses and adjusted logistic regression models to investigate publication trends and associations between SD and methodology terms. Results: MetaMap had a text mining precision, recall, and false positive rate of 0.70, 0.77, and 11.51%, respectively. The most common SD term was breathing-related sleep disorder, whereas narcolepsy was the least common. Cluster analyses showed similar methodology clusters for each SD term, except narcolepsy. The logistic regression models showed an increasing prevalence of insomnia, parasomnia, and other sleep disorders but a decreasing prevalence of breathing-related sleep disorder during 2000-2013. Different SD terms were positively associated with different methodology terms regarding research design terms, measure terms, and analysis terms. Conclusion: Insomnia-, parasomnia-, and other sleep disorder-related articles showed an increasing publication trend, whereas those related to breathing-related sleep disorder showed a decreasing trend. Furthermore, experimental studies more commonly focused on hypersomnia and other SDs and less commonly on insomnia, breathing-related sleep disorder, narcolepsy, and parasomnia. Thus, text mining may facilitate the exploration of the publication trends in SDs and the associated methodologies. © 2016 Lam et al.

N2  - Background: “Evidence Mapping” is an emerging tool that is increasingly being used to systematically identify, review, organize, quantify, and summarize the literature. It can be used as an effective method for identifying well-studied topic areas relevant to a broad research question along with any important literature gaps. However, because the procedure can be significantly resource-intensive, approaches that can increase the speed and reproducibility of evidence mapping are in great demand. Methods: We propose an alternative process called “rapid Evidence Mapping” (rEM) to map the scientific evidence in a time-efficient manner, while still utilizing rigorous, transparent and explicit methodological approaches. To illustrate its application, we have conducted a proof-of-concept case study on the topic of low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) with respect to human dietary exposures and health outcomes. During this process, we developed and made publicly available our study protocol, established a PECO (Participants, Exposure, Comparator, and Outcomes) statement, searched the literature, screened titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant studies, and applied semi-automated machine learning approaches to tag and categorize the included articles. We created various visualizations including bubble plots and frequency tables to map the evidence and research gaps according to comparison type, population baseline health status, outcome group, and study sample size. We compared our results with a traditional evidence mapping of the same topic published in 2016 (Wang et al., 2016). Results: We conducted an rEM of LCS, for which we identified 8122 records from a PubMed search (January 1, 1946–May 1, 2014) and then utilized machine learning (SWIFT-Active Screener) to prioritize relevant records. After screening 2267 (28%) of the total set of titles and abstracts to achieve 95% estimated recall, we ultimately included 297 relevant studies. Overall, our findings corroborated those of Wang et al. (2016) and identified that most studies were acute or short-term in healthy individuals, and studied the outcomes of appetite, energy sensing and body weight. We also identified a lack of studies assessing appetite and dietary intake related outcomes in people with diabetes. The rEM approach required approximately 100 person-hours conducted over 7 calendar months. Conclusion: Rapid Evidence Mapping is an expeditious approach based on rigorous methodology that can be used to quickly summarize the available body of evidence relevant to a research question, identify gaps in the literature to inform future research, and contextualize the design of a systematic review within the broader scientific literature, significantly reducing human effort while yielding results comparable to those from traditional methods. The potential time savings of this approach in comparison to the traditional evidence mapping process make it a potentially powerful tool for rapidly translating knowledge to inform science-based decision-making. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - The goal of a review article is to present the current state of knowledge in a research area. Two important initial steps in writing a review article are boundary identification (identifying a body of potentially relevant past research) and corpus construction (selecting research manuscripts to include in the review). We present a theory-as-discourse approach, which (1) creates a theory ecosystem of potentially relevant prior research using a citation-network approach to boundary identification; and (2) identifies manuscripts for consideration using machine learning or random selection. We demonstrate an instantiation of the theory as discourse approach through a proof-of-concept, which we call the automated detection of implicit theory (ADIT) technique. ADIT improves performance over the conventional approach as practiced in past technology acceptance model reviews (i.e., keyword search, sometimes manual citation chaining); it identifies a set of research manuscripts that is more comprehensive and at least as precise. Our analysis shows that the conventional approach failed to identify a majority of past research. Like the three blind men examining the elephant, the conventional approach distorts the totality of the phenomenon. ADIT also enables researchers to statistically estimate the number of relevant manuscripts that were excluded from the resulting review article, thus enabling an assessment of the review article’s representativeness. © 2019 by the Association for Information Systems.

PD  - 
N2  - Background: Qualitative technical communication research often produces datasets that are too large to manage effectively with hand-coded approaches. Text-mining methods, used carefully, may uncover patterns and provide results for larger datasets that are more easily reproduced and scaled. Research questions: 1. To what degree can hand collection results be replicated by automated data collection? 2. To what degree can hand-coded results be replicated by machine coding? 3. What are the affordances and limitations of each method? Literature review: We introduce the stages of data collection and analysis that researchers typically discuss in the literature, and show how researchers in technical communication and other fields have discussed the affordances and limitations of hand collection and coding versus automated methods throughout each stage. Research methodology: We utilize an existing dataset that was hand-collected and hand-coded. We discuss the collection and coding processes, and demonstrate how they might be replicated with web scraping and machine coding. Results/discussion: We found that web scraping demonstrated an obvious advantage of automated data collection: Speed. Machine coding was able to provide comparable outputs to hand coding for certain types of data; for more nuanced and verbally complex data, machine coding was less useful and less reliable. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of considering the context of a particular project when weighing the affordances and limitations of hand collecting and coding over automated approaches. Ultimately, a mixed-methods approach that relies on a combination of hand coding and automated coding should prove to be the most productive for current and future kinds of technical communication work, in which close attention to the nuances of language is critical, but in which processing large amounts of data would yield significant benefits as well. © 2018 IEEE.

N2  - Digital transformation (DT) is the process of combining digital technologies with sound business models to generate great value for enterprises. DT intertwines with customer requirements, domain knowledge, and theoretical and empirical insights for value propagations. Studies of DT are growing rapidly and heterogeneously, covering the aspects of product design, engineering, production, and life-cycle management due to the fast and market-driven industrial development under Industry 4.0. Our work addresses the challenge of understanding DT trends by presenting a machine learning (ML) approach for topic modeling to review and analyze advanced DT technology research and development. A systematic review process is developed based on the comprehensive DT in manufacturing systems and engineering literature (i.e., 99 articles). Six dominant topics are identified, namely smart factory, sustainability and product-service systems, construction digital transformation, public infrastructure-centric digital transformation, techno-centric digital transformation, and business model-centric digital transformation. The study also contributes to adopting and demonstrating the ML-based topic modeling for intelligent and systematic bibliometric analysis, particularly for unveiling advanced engineering research trends through domain literature. © 2021

PD  - 
N2  - This paper aims to identify research topics about the theme of port based on a corpus of articles published in Korean and international academic journals after the 2000s through a comprehensive literature review. Scanning the literature on port enables the authors to list up common research topics by comparing each journal paper. The scope of literature survey for this paper is limited to articles appeared in international journals in the category of seaport in science citation index (SCI) and Korea Citation Index (KCI) level journals. This study applies the topic modeling approach on collected texts and completes mapping of research trends and patterns of the existing literature by inferring key topics. This paper contributes to the literature of port research by comparing the research trends of Korean and international journals, illuminating crucial gaps that the previous studies have not addressed. Also, results in this study show that future research should focus on port cooperation and the environmental issues for the sustainable development of ports. Valuable insight from observations of this study is that the gap between recent challenges of port and topics of port studies in Korean journals needs to be bridged. This study could inspire some new discussions on port research and potential directions. © 2019

N2  - Sponge City research has been attracting extensive attention both in practical and theoretical research field, as the increased threat of flood risk and environmental safety due to urbanization. Varies names of Sponge City prevalent in different countries, which leads to disconnection of literature in the same field of Sponge City. In this paper, a systematic literature mining of Sponge City is presented. A literature analysis system is created, which includes literature export from Web of Sciences and systematic analysis via NoteExpress and CiteSpace. Based on the final document storage which contains 962 articles, general trends are identified. Literature is classified into 9 theme types. Research foci of Sponge City are detected by citation and keywords burst detection. Further, some future research directions of Sponge City are anticipated, including trans-disciplinary approaches, a comprehensive design framework, application of information technology, and case studies of Sponge City in more parts of the world. The significance of this paper lies in summarizing past research, identifying research types, foci and anticipating some future research directions. © 2018 by the authors.

N2  - There have been many attempts to transform cities into smart cities worldwide. However, it is difficult to understand and describe smart cities from different perspectives, given the widespread application of the concept of smart city in diverse disciplines, such as urban planning, electronic engineering, and computer sciences. This work conducted a comprehensive smart city literature review based on text mining of 3,315 papers on smart cities published in journals indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index databases. These include “all papers” classified as research articles published from 1999 to April 2020. Our findings show the state of the art of research on smart cities, including (i) smart city literature statistics from 1999 to 2019, (ii) 23 research topics related to smart cities, and (iii) geographical variations in smart-city research. Based on these findings, we offer theoretical and practical implications of (1) missing fields of studies, (2) future research directions, and (3) the applicability of text-mining techniques to literature reviews. We believe that this work, which aims to establish a common ground for understanding smart cities from multiple disciplinary perspectives, will encourage further research and development regarding smart cities. © 2021 The Authors

N2  - By using publications from Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), Fosso Wamba and his colleagues published an interesting and comprehensive paper in Technological Forecasting and Social Change to explore the structure and dynamics of artificial intelligence (AI) scholarship. Data demonstrated in Fosso Wamba's study implied that the year 1991 seemed to be a “watershed” of AI research. This research note tried to uncover the 1991 phenomenon from the perspective of database limitation by probing the limitations of search in abstract/author keywords/keywords plus fields of WoSCC empirically. The low availability rates of abstract/author keywords/keywords plus information in WoSCC found in this study can explain the “watershed” phenomenon of AI scholarship in 1991 to a large extent. The findings in this study are also applicable to other WoSCC-based studies focusing on fields from natural science, social sciences, to arts and humanities. Besides, some other caveats for the use of WoSCC in old literature retrieval and historical bibliometric analysis were also mentioned in the discussion section. This research note complements Fosso Wamba and his colleagues’ study and also helps avoid improper interpretation in the use of WoSCC in old literature retrieval and historical bibliometric analysis. © 2021

N2  - The CONSORT 2010 statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomized trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials–Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human–AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes. © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: In recent years, the rapid growth of big data has presented immense potential for business applications as well as raised great interest from academia. In response to this emerging phenomenon, the purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review of big data. Design/methodology/approach: A bibliometric method was used to analyze the articles obtained from the Scopus database published between 2013 and 2018. A sample size of 4,070 articles was evaluated using SciVal metrics. Findings: The analysis revealed an array of interesting findings as follows: the number of publications related to big data increased steadily over the past six years, though the rate of increase has slowed since 2014; the scope of big data research is quite broad in regards to both research domains and countries; despite a large volume of publications, the overall performance of big data research is not well presented as measured by the field-weighted citation impact metric; collaboration between different institutions, particularly in the form of international collaboration and academic–corporate collaboration, has played an important role in improving the performance of big data research. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to provide a holistic view of the big data research. The insights obtained from the analysis are instrumental for both academics and practitioners. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - PolySearch2 (http://polysearch.ca) is an online textmining system for identifying relationships between biomedical entities such as human diseases, genes, SNPs, proteins, drugs, metabolites, toxins, metabolic pathways, organs, tissues, subcellular organelles, positive health effects, negative health effects, drug actions, Gene Ontology terms, MeSH terms, ICD- 10 medical codes, biological taxonomies and chemical taxonomies. PolySearch2 supports a generalized 'Given X, find all associated Ys' query, where X and Y can be selected from the aforementioned biomedical entities. An example query might be: 'Find all diseases associated with Bisphenol A'. To find its answers, PolySearch2 searches for associations against comprehensive collections of free-text collections, including local versions of MEDLINE abstracts, PubMed Central full-text articles, Wikipedia full-text articles and US Patent application abstracts. PolySearch2 also searches 14 widely used, text-rich biological databases such as UniProt, DrugBank and Human Metabolome Database to improve its accuracy and coverage. PolySearch2 maintains an extensive thesaurus of biological terms and exploits the latest search engine technology to rapidly retrieve relevant articles and databases records. PolySearch2 also generates, ranks and annotates associative candidates and present results with relevancy statistics and highlighted key sentences to facilitate user interpretation. © 2015 The Author(s).

The decoupling of construction industry and carbon emissions through policies, technologies and model innovations is an effective way for reducing environmental pollution and achieve eco-urban target. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Within the scope of green building carbon emissions (GB-CO2) research, a large number of scientific literature has been published in construction discipline over the past few decades. However, it seems that a systematic summary of strategies, techniques, models and scientific discussion of future direction of GB-CO2 is lacking. Therefore, this paper carries out data mining on authoritative journals, identified the key research topics, active research areas and further research trends through visualization studies. Findings: This study contributes to the body of knowledge in GB-CO2 by critically reviewing and summarizing: professional high-quality journals have a greater influence in the scope of research, developed countries and developing countries are all very concerned about sustainable buildings, and the current hot topics of research focus on the application of the life cycle models, energy efficiency, environmental performance of concrete material, etc. Moreover, further research areas that could expand the knowledge of cross-national long-term carbon mechanisms, develop comprehensive life cycle carbon emissions assessment models, build technical standards and tests for the sustainable building material and systems, and exploit multi-objective decision models considering decarbonizing design and renewable energy. Originality/value: This study is of value in systematic insight the state-of-the-art of GB-CO2 research in the more recent decade. A more vividly and effectively method is documented in extending the traditional bibliometric review to a deeper discussion. This study can also benefit construction practitioners by providing them a focused perspective of strategy and technologies innovations for emerging practices in green building projects. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 has challenged global public health because it is highly contagious and can be lethal. Numerous ongoing and recently published studies about the disease have emerged. However, the research regarding COVID-19 is largely ongoing and inconclusive. Objective: A potential way to accelerate COVID-19 research is to use existing information gleaned from research into other viruses that belong to the coronavirus family. Our objective is to develop a natural language processing method for answering factoid questions related to COVID-19 using published articles as knowledge sources. Methods: Given a question, first, a BM25-based context retriever model is implemented to select the most relevant passages from previously published articles. Second, for each selected context passage, an answer is obtained using a pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) question-answering model. Third, an opinion aggregator, which is a combination of a biterm topic model and k-means clustering, is applied to the task of aggregating all answers into several opinions. Results: We applied the proposed pipeline to extract answers, opinions, and the most frequent words related to six questions from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge. By showing the longitudinal distributions of the opinions, we uncovered the trends of opinions and popular words in the articles published in the five time periods assessed: before 1990, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, 2010-2018, and since 2019. The changes in opinions and popular words agree with several distinct characteristics and challenges of COVID-19, including a higher risk for senior people and people with pre-existing medical conditions; high contagion and rapid transmission; and a more urgent need for screening and testing. The opinions and popular words also provide additional insights for the COVID-19-related questions. Conclusions: Compared with other methods of literature retrieval and answer generation, opinion aggregation using our method leads to more interpretable, robust, and comprehensive question-specific literature reviews. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method in answering COVID-19-related questions with main opinions and capturing the trends of research about COVID-19 and other relevant strains of coronavirus in recent years. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

N2  - Species traits are a new data currency to enhance our understanding of ecological patterns and processes. Trait-based studies of fishes are numerous in comparison with other animal groups, reflecting the diversity of fish forms and functions they provide to aquatic ecosystems. We conduct a retrospective examination of literature to identify knowledge gaps and provide guidance for future research in trait-based fish ecology. We apply an automated text mining and topic modelling to track the evolution of research topics within peer-reviewed articles of functional traits in marine and freshwater fishes published over the past half century, explore the inter-connections among those topics and identify emerging avenues for investigation. By mapping the topic landscape of the literature, 16 latent topics emerged that vary in their prevalence. Our results show a decline in the frequency of studies using reproductive traits to model and explore the way fish allocate energy for reproduction, and increase in studies reporting functional diversity metrics and utilizing the concept of multivariate functional space. Research focused on contributions of fish traits to ecosystem functioning also has increased in frequency. We revealed large gaps in information between growing and decreasing topics and that these gaps were derived from different types of traits being considered. We suggest that scientists break-free from the traditions of their research field by targeting investigations that: (a) apply functional diversity metrics to a broader assortment of traits, (b) focus on traits influencing energy allocation to growth/reproduction and (c) integrate trophic-web and behavioural studies with other topics. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Objectives Locating overviews of systematic reviews is difficult because of an absence of appropriate indexing terms and inconsistent terminology used to describe overviews. Our objective was to develop a validated search strategy to retrieve overviews in MEDLINE. Study Design and Setting We derived a test set of overviews from the references of two method articles on overviews. Two population sets were used to identify discriminating terms, that is, terms that appear frequently in the test set but infrequently in two population sets of references found in MEDLINE. We used text mining to conduct a frequency analysis of terms appearing in the titles and abstracts. Candidate terms were combined and tested in MEDLINE in various permutations, and the performance of strategies measured using sensitivity and precision. Results Two search strategies were developed: a sensitivity-maximizing strategy, achieving 93% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI]: 87, 96) and 7% precision (95% CI: 6, 8), and a sensitivity-and-precision-maximizing strategy, achieving 66% sensitivity (95% CI: 58, 74) and 21% precision (95% CI: 17, 25). Conclusion The developed search strategies enable users to more efficiently identify overviews of reviews compared to current strategies. Consistent language in describing overviews would aid in their identification, as would a specific MEDLINE Publication Type. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The use of games in education represents a promising tool to motivate and engage students in their learning process. Most of previous research on the topic has focused to develop theoretical frameworks or to conduct experiments as a means to analyse learning outcomes such as knowledge retention, problem-solving skills gains or attitudes toward game-based learning. Nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research has evolved over the last years. In this study, we use a bibliometric, social network and text mining analysis in order to provide useful up-to-date information to picture the state of the art about current research and evolution of the topic. Analysis on a sample of 139 articles published in top journals over the last 5 years (2010–2014) allowed identifying relevant authors and institutions, key constructs and themes involved, and trends of knowledge development. Main findings suggest an increasing academic interest on the topic over the last 5 years and a wide variety of constructs that were clustered in four main themes that we named: (i) effectiveness, (ii) acceptance, (iii) engagement and (iv) social interactions. Future research lines are also addressed. Lay Description: What is currently known about the use of games in education: Games can increase students' intrinsic motivation to learn. Games support active learning. Games facilitate scaffolded instruction based on each individual student's needs. What this paper adds to this: This study identifies the most relevant researchers in this research area. This study identifies the most relevant institutions involved in this research area. This study identifies the main topics and themes researched by researchers. This study identifies the main methodological approach used by researchers. Findings for practitioners: Relevant researchers and institutions to collaborate with. Topics and themes under research.

N2  - Readability is a big challenge that must be solved in automatic text summarization research. The aim of this study is to comprehensively and systematically investigate the literatures that are related with text summarization needs, in particular, to prepare efficient algorithm for Indonesian text using Deep Learning and Sequential Pattern Mining. Evidence from previous literatures shows that there are several studies which use Sequential Pattern Mining to extract representation of text for document clustering and classification of Indonesian text. However, not much attention was given to text representation in document summarization, specifically for Indonesian language. As readability is a major concern in the text summarization community, determining a better text representation to maintain the meaning of the generated text summary is deemed necessary. This paper gives an opportunity to take a deeper look into how to design an efficient and effective text representation which can further enhance text summarization readability. Besides the general systematic literature review, we discuss an idea to combine Deep Learning and Sequential Pattern Mining to improve readability of summary result to develop in the future. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent gynecological disorder that affects at least 10% of women of reproductive age. It may lead to infertility and non-specific symptoms such as chronic pelvic pain. Endometriosis screening and diagnosis are difficult and time-consuming. Late diagnosis (with a delay ranging from 3.3 to 10.7 years) is a major problem and may contribute to disease progression and a worse response to treatment once initiated. Efficient screening tests might reduce this diagnostic delay. As endometriosis is presumed to be a complex disease with several genetic and non-genetic pathogenic factors, many researchers have sought to identify polymorphisms that predispose to this condition. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the most regularly reported polymorphisms in order to identify those that might predispose to endometriosis and might thus be of value in screening. SEARCH METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched for English-language publications on DNA polymorphisms in endometriosis, with no date restriction. The PubTator text mining tool was used to extract gene names from the selected publications' abstracts. We only selected polymorphisms reported by at least three studies, having applied strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to their control populations. No stratification based on ethnicity was performed. All steps were carried out according to PRISMA guidelines. OUTCOMES: The initial selection of 395 publications cited 242 different genes. Sixty-two genes (corresponding to 265 different polymorphisms) were cited at least in three publications. After the application of our other selection criteria (an original case-control study of endometriosis, a reported association between endometriosis and at least one polymorphism, data on women of reproductive age and a diagnosis of endometriosis in the cases established by surgery and/or MRI and confirmed by histology), 28 polymorphisms were eligible for meta-analysis. Only five of the 28 polymorphisms were found to be significantly associated with endometriosis: interferon gamma (IFNG) (CA) repeat, glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) null genotype, glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) rs1695 and wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 4 (WNT4) rs16826658 and rs2235529. Six others showed a significant trend towards an association: progesterone receptor (PGR) PROGINS, interCellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) rs1799969, aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) rs2292596, cytochrome family 17 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP17A1) rs743572, CYP2C19 rs4244285 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) rs1801282), and 12 showed a significant trend towards the lack of an association: tumor necrosis factor (TNF) rs1799964, interleukin 6 (IL6) rs1800796, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) rs1800469, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) rs2234693, PGR rs10895068, FSH receptor (FSHR) rs6166, ICAM1 rs5498, CYP1A1 rs4646903, CYP19A1 rs10046, tumor protein 53 (TP53) rs1042522, X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 1 (XRCC1) rs25487 and serpin peptidase inhibitor clade E member 1 (SERPINE1) rs1799889; however, for the 18 polymorphisms identified in the latter two groups, further studies of the potential association with the endometriosis risk are needed. The remaining five of the 28 polymorphisms were not associated with endometriosis: glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1) null genotype, vascular endothelial growth factor alpha (VEGFA) rs699947, rs833061, rs2010963 and rs3025039. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: By carefully taking account of how the control populations were defined, we identified polymorphisms that might be candidates for use in endometriosis screening and polymorphisms not associated with endometriosis. This might constitute the first step towards identifying polymorphism combinations that predispose to endometriosis (IFNG (CA) repeat, GSTM1 null genotype, GSTP1 rs1695, WNT4 rs16826658 and WNT4 rs2235529) in a large cohort of patients with wel -defined inclusion criteria. In turn, these results might improve the diagnosis of endometriosis in primary care. Lastly, our present findings may enable a better understanding of endometriosis and improve the management of patients with this disease. © The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - Extraction and analysis of useful knowledge from the vast amount of relevant published literature can add valuable insights to any research theme or area of interest. We introduce a simplified bibliometric data analysis protocol for gaining substantial insights into research thematics, which can also serve as a handy practical skill for researchers while working from home. In this paper, we provide ways of developing a holistic research strategy using bibliometric-data driven approaches that integrate network analysis and information management, without the need for full paper access. This protocol is a comprehensive multi-modular pathway for analysis of metadata obtained from major scientific publishing houses by the use of a Decision Support System (DSS). A simple case study on the invasive species Lantana camara has been presented as a proof-of-concept to show how one can implement this DSS based protocol. Some perspectives are also provided on how the outcomes can be used directly or scaled up for long term research interventions. We hope that this work will simplify exploratory literature review, and enable rational design of research objectives for scholars, as well as the development of comprehensive grant proposals that address gaps in research. © 2021, Indian National Science Academy.

N2  - Ontologies, as semantic knowledge representation, have a crucial role in various information systems. The main pitfall of manually building ontologies is effort and time-consuming. Ontology learning is a key solution. Learning Non-Taxonomic Relationships of Ontologies (LNTRO) is the process of automatic/semi-automatic extraction of all possible relationships between concepts in a specific domain, except the hierarchal relations. Most of the research works focused on the extraction of concepts and taxonomic relations in the ontology learning process. This article presents the results of a systematic review of the state-of-the-art approaches for LNTRO. Sixteen approaches have been described and qualitatively analyzed. The solutions they provide are discussed along with their respective positive and negative aspects. The goal is to provide researchers in this area a comprehensive understanding of the drawbacks of the existing work, thereby encouraging further improvement of the research work in this area. Furthermore, this article proposes a set of recommendations for future research. Copyright © 2021, IGI Global.

TI  - The intriguing evolution of effect sizes in biomedical research over time: Smaller but more often statistically significant
AU  - Monsarrat, P.
AU  - Vergnes, J. N.
PY  - 2018
PD  - 
N2  - Background: In medicine, effect sizes (ESs) allow the effects of independent variables (including risk/protective factors or treatment interventions) on dependent variables (e.g., health outcomes) to be quantified. Given that many public health decisions and health care policies are based on ES estimates, it is important to assess how ESs are used in the biomedical literature and to investigate potential trends in their reporting over time. Results: Through a big data approach, the text mining process automatically extracted 814 120 ESs from 13 322 754 PubMed abstracts. Eligible ESs were risk ratio, odds ratio, and hazard ratio, along with their confidence intervals. Here we show a remarkable decrease of ES values in PubMed abstracts between 1990 and 2015 while, concomitantly, results become more often statistically significant. Medians of ES values have decreased over time for both "risk" and "protective" values. This trend was found in nearly all fields of biomedical research, with the most marked downward tendency in genetics. Over the same period, the proportion of statistically significant ESs increased regularly: among the abstracts with at least 1 ES, 74% were statistically significant in 1990-1995, vs 85% in 2010-2015. Conclusions: whereas decreasing ESs could be an intrinsic evolution in biomedical research, the concomitant increase of statistically significant results is more intriguing. Although it is likely that growing sample sizes in biomedical research could explain these results, another explanation may lie in the "publish or perish" context of scientific research, with the probability of a growing orientation toward sensationalism in research reports. Important provisions must be made to improve the credibility of biomedical research and limit waste of resources. © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - Circular economy (CE) and sustainability are interrelated, without being exchangeable. While sustainability tries to reconcile the management of productive resources with their increasing consumption, CE aims to make the productive process more efficient, reducing, reusing and recycling the results of the productive process as much as possible. The aim of this paper is to ascertain the systemic structure of interactions between sustainability and CE through the analysis of the existing literature from 2004 to 2021. For this purpose, a computational literature review and a content analysis of the main contributions of CE and sustainability, within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), were conducted. The results show that there is a positive impact of the synergy between CE strategies and certain SDGs. Specifically, the circular strategies that generate the greatest synergies have to do with preserving materials through recycling, downcycling, and the measurement of indicators or reference scenarios. This is what has led to the inclusion of these concepts in the formulation of policies and strategies, as their multidisciplinary nature allows them to have an impact on areas such as agriculture or innovation, which currently lack specific measures. Therefore, the knowledge derived from this study will contribute favorably to future decisions and actions to be considered, as there is still the potential to legislate in favor of an even more sustainable framework. © 2021 by the authors.

However, due to the limitations of human data processing, the literature review can suffer from an inability to handle large volumes of research articles. The computational literature review (CLR) is proposed here as a complementary part of a wider literature review process. The CLR automates some of the analysis of research articles with analyses of impact (citations), structure (co-authorship networks) and content (topic modeling of abstracts). A contribution of the paper is to demonstrate how the content of abstracts can be analyzed automatically to provide a set of research topics within a literature corpus. The CLR software can be used to support three use cases: (1) analysis of the literature for a research area, (2) analysis and ranking of journals, and (3) analysis and ranking of individual scholars and research teams. The working of the CLR software is illustrated through application to the technology acceptance model (TAM) using a set of 3,386 articles. The CLR is an open source offering, developed in the statistical programming language R, and made freely available to researchers to use and develop further. © 2016

N2  - An important aspect of post-marketing drug surveillance involves identifying potential side-effects utilizing adverse drug event (ADE) reporting systems and/or Electronic Health Records. These data are noisy, necessitating identified drug/ADE associations be manually reviewed - a human-intensive process that scales poorly with large numbers of possibly dangerous associations and rapid growth of biomedical literature. Recent work has employed Literature Based Discovery methods that exploit implicit relationships between biomedical entities within the literature to estimate the plausibility of drug/ADE connections. We extend this work by evaluating machine learning classifiers applied to high-dimensional vector representations of relationships extracted from the literature as a means to identify substantiated drug/ADE connections. Using a curated reference standard, we show applying classifiers to such representations improves performance (+≈37%AUC) over previous approaches. These trained systems reproduce outcomes of the manual literature review process used to create the reference standard, but further research is required to establish their generalizability.

PD  - 
N2  - Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have become an indispensable tool in all fields dealing with geographic data in academia as well as the public and private sector. After some initial reservations, human geography and other social sciences have also embraced GIS technologies especially by extending and adjusting the available data models for qualitative data. The result was coined qualitative GIS. Given the diversity and fragmentation of the research in which qualitative GIS have been applied, a comprehensive literature review is overdue. Therefore, we retrieved all articles that dealt with qualitative GIS from the ISI Web of Science. From the resulting 380 relevant manuscripts, we extracted study-specific information and analyzed it by means of descriptive statistics, text mining, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and k-means clustering. Our results reveal four major thematic domains within which qualitative GIS research takes place, namely, “conceptual contributions to qualitative GIS,” “theory and empiricism of public participation GIS,” “health, youth, and the urban environment,” and “ecosystem services, landscapes, and tourism”. Some of these trends are popular in specific regions (e.g., “ecosystem services, landscapes, and tourism” research in Australia). Furthermore, we found that a large body of studies lacks clear information on the used software packages and that the share of free open-source GIS software is negligible. Overall, we would encourage more transparency, a wider use of open-source software, and interdisciplinary collaboration to even further advance and promote qualitative GIS research. To put our recommendations into practice, we made the data used in this manuscript and the corresponding analysis publicly accessible (https://github.com/jannes-m/qual_gis). To further facilitate the replication of our results, we exclusively used open-source software, namely, R, leaflet, and PostgreSQL. These and other open-source software packages, for example, Python and QGIS, might have the potential to fundamentally change the way to conduct qualitative GIS research. This is equally true for methods borrowed from other fields such as ordinations, cluster algorithms, and interactive web mapping, which might be promising tools in human geography and the social sciences. © 2019 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is a fast-evolving area of research, bringing together knowledge from multiple academic fields into creative solutions for manufacturing innovation. Despite the growing amount of published work covering a wide range of I4.0 areas, there has been relatively little research devoted to the organisational side of implementing I4.0. To address this gap, this systematic review paper used quantitative analysis by text-mining 97 articles from 2015 to 2021. The analysis identified eleven research streams, which were grouped into five levels, namely industry and firm, smart factory, data, human resources and supply chain. The research streams were then comprehensively reviewed and presented. For each stream, the paper presents a number of sub-themes and highlights important findings and areas that may require further development. We discuss three important research avenues in the organisational management literature: (1) the impact of the pandemic on the implementation of I4.0, (2) the tension between value creation and value protection during the implementation of 4.0 and (3) the relevance of a contingency approach during the implementation of I4.0. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Agent-based simulation has been used to study a wide variety of complex and social systems. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive and multi-dimensional analysis of the application of agent-based modelling and simulation in marketing. Papers are evaluated with respect to types of interaction and communication channels, individual cognitive decision-making styles, social system structures, application area, goals of the simulation study, and other model properties. Furthermore, network analysis and text-mining methods are employed as two novel approaches to establish the current state of the literature and reveal literature trends, gaps, and strengths. Various emergent phenomena and important findings from the application of agent-based simulation in different areas within marketing are also discussed. Finally, the results of the literature analysis are used to make future research recommendations by providing an architecture for conceptual model design and general guidelines to increase the credibility of agent-based models in the marketing domain. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.

PY  - 2021
PD  - 
N2  - Purpose: This paper aims to report a comprehensive analysis of literature on stakeholder relationships towards identifying patterns of relationships within the off-site construction context. Design/methodology/approach: Key scholarly databases were accessed and after a filtering process, 74 relevant papers were retrieved for analysis. The papers were analysed using qualitative content analysis and scientometric techniques through the application of software Leximancer and VOSviewer. Findings: Research synthesis methods used in the present study generate compatible results. Through text mining analysis, the key themes identified in the off-site construction stakeholder relationships literature included “collaboration”, “building information modelling”, “social network analysis”, supply chain. As a finding by scientometric analysis, collaboration, BIM, supply chain management, housing and social network analysis were the most frequently entered keywords context of off-site construction. Regarding authorship pattern, the whole network of collaboration was fragmented into multiple isolated clusters, implying that the authors had tendency to cooperate in small groups. Practical implications: The paper can bring together an important area of research not previously studied in detail. It will primarily assist academics in the first instance; however, the research leads to important findings that will ultimately assist policymakers and practitioners better understand factors affecting stakeholder relationships and in particular network thinking and collaborative mind-sets. Originality/value: The review contributes a needed systematic and theoretical foundation for future stakeholder relationship studies and practices in off-site construction sector. It provides the basis for future studies and is a seminal analysis of stakeholder management and off-site construction. The scientometric methodology offers scholars a different approach to analysing and visualising literature reviews. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - 3D printing (3DP) is regarded as an innovation that contributes to automation in civil engineering and offers benefits in design, greenness, and efficiency. It is necessary to objectively analyze the current status and challenges associated with 3DP and identify future research directions to properly understand its construction applications. Previous research has focused more on the technical dimension of 3DP; however, the nontechnical dimension of the technology may hinder its implementation and thus must be paid particular attention to. This study presents a systematic review of the existing literature from both technical and nontechnical dimensions by combining quantitative and qualitative studies. The quantitative study was conducted using scientometric methods. The qualitative study analyzed information, including the technical research status and nontechnical challenges and trends. Two aspects of technical research status are presented, including materials and processes. In addition, nontechnical challenges and trends from the economic, environmental, social, and legislative aspects are proposed. This study provides a comprehensive agenda to advance 3DP in construction and proposes research interests, challenges, and future topics. It is intended to help construction practitioners systematically master existing processes and materials and assess the application degree and necessity of 3DP. © 2021 Xin Ning et al.

N2  - Background: The large and increasing number of new studies published each year is making literature identification in systematic reviews ever more time-consuming and costly. Technological assistance has been suggested as an alternative to the conventional, manual study identification to mitigate the cost, but previous literature has mainly evaluated methods in terms of recall (search sensitivity) and workload reduction. There is a need to also evaluate whether screening prioritization methods leads to the same results and conclusions as exhaustive manual screening. In this study, we examined the impact of one screening prioritization method based on active learning on sensitivity and specificity estimates in systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. Methods: We simulated the screening process in 48 Cochrane reviews of diagnostic test accuracy and re-run 400 meta-analyses based on a least 3 studies. We compared screening prioritization (with technological assistance) and screening in randomized order (standard practice without technology assistance). We examined if the screening could have been stopped before identifying all relevant studies while still producing reliable summary estimates. For all meta-analyses, we also examined the relationship between the number of relevant studies and the reliability of the final estimates. Results: The main meta-analysis in each systematic review could have been performed after screening an average of 30% of the candidate articles (range 0.07 to 100%). No systematic review would have required screening more than 2308 studies, whereas manual screening would have required screening up to 43,363 studies. Despite an average 70% recall, the estimation error would have been 1.3% on average, compared to an average 2% estimation error expected when replicating summary estimate calculations. Conclusion: Screening prioritization coupled with stopping criteria in diagnostic test accuracy reviews can reliably detect when the screening process has identified a sufficient number of studies to perform the main meta-analysis with an accuracy within pre-specified tolerance limits. However, many of the systematic reviews did not identify a sufficient number of studies that the meta-analyses were accurate within a 2% limit even with exhaustive manual screening, i.e., using current practice. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - The second meeting of the International Collaboration for Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR) was held 3-4 October 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. ICASR is an interdisciplinary group whose aim is to maximize the use of technology for conducting rapid, accurate, and efficient systematic reviews of scientific evidence. Having automated tools for systematic review should enable more transparent and timely review, maximizing the potential for identifying and translating research findings to practical application. The meeting brought together multiple stakeholder groups including users of summarized research, methodologists who explore production processes and systematic review quality, and technologists such as software developers, statisticians, and vendors. This diversity of participants was intended to ensure effective communication with numerous stakeholders about progress toward automation of systematic reviews and stimulate discussion about potential solutions to identified challenges. The meeting highlighted challenges, both simple and complex, and raised awareness among participants about ongoing efforts by various stakeholders. An outcome of this forum was to identify several short-term projects that participants felt would advance the automation of tasks in the systematic review workflow including (1) fostering better understanding about available tools, (2) developing validated datasets for testing new tools, (3) determining a standard method to facilitate interoperability of tools such as through an application programming interface or API, and (4) establishing criteria to evaluate the quality of tools' output. ICASR 2016 provided a beneficial forum to foster focused discussion about tool development and resources and reconfirm ICASR members' commitment toward systematic reviews' automation. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Although many aspects of systematic reviews use computational tools, systematic reviewers have been reluctant to adopt machine learning tools. Discussion: We discuss that the potential reason for the slow adoption of machine learning tools into systematic reviews is multifactorial. We focus on the current absence of trust in automation and set-up challenges as major barriers to adoption. It is important that reviews produced using automation tools are considered non-inferior or superior to current practice. However, this standard will likely not be sufficient to lead to widespread adoption. As with many technologies, it is important that reviewers see "others" in the review community using automation tools. Adoption will also be slow if the automation tools are not compatible with workflows and tasks currently used to produce reviews. Many automation tools being developed for systematic reviews mimic classification problems. Therefore, the evidence that these automation tools are non-inferior or superior can be presented using methods similar to diagnostic test evaluations, i.e., precision and recall compared to a human reviewer. However, the assessment of automation tools does present unique challenges for investigators and systematic reviewers, including the need to clarify which metrics are of interest to the systematic review community and the unique documentation challenges for reproducible software experiments. Conclusion: We discuss adoption barriers with the goal of providing tool developers with guidance as to how to design and report such evaluations and for end users to assess their validity. Further, we discuss approaches to formatting and announcing publicly available datasets suitable for assessment of automation technologies and tools. Making these resources available will increase trust that tools are non-inferior or superior to current practice. Finally, we identify that, even with evidence that automation tools are non-inferior or superior to current practice, substantial set-up challenges remain for main stream integration of automation into the systematic review process. © 2019 The Author(s).

PY  - 2017
PD  - 
N2  - Context Independent validation of published scientific results through study replication is a pre-condition for accepting the validity of such results. In computation research, full replication is often unrealistic for independent results validation, therefore, study reproduction has been justified as the minimum acceptable standard to evaluate the validity of scientific claims. The application of text mining techniques to citation screening in the context of systematic literature reviews is a relatively young and growing computational field with high relevance for software engineering, medical research and other fields. However, there is little work so far on reproduction studies in the field. Objective In this paper, we investigate the reproducibility of studies in this area based on information contained in published articles and we propose reporting guidelines that could improve reproducibility. Methods The study was approached in two ways. Initially we attempted to reproduce results from six studies, which were based on the same raw dataset. Then, based on this experience, we identified steps considered essential to successful reproduction of text mining experiments and characterized them to measure how reproducible is a study given the information provided on these steps. 33 articles were systematically assessed for reproducibility using this approach. Results Our work revealed that it is currently difficult if not impossible to independently reproduce the results published in any of the studies investigated. The lack of information about the datasets used limits reproducibility of about 80% of the studies assessed. Also, information about the machine learning algorithms is inadequate in about 27% of the papers. On the plus side, the third party software tools used are mostly free and available. Conclusions The reproducibility potential of most of the studies can be significantly improved if more attention is paid to information provided on the datasets used, how they were partitioned and utilized, and how any randomization was controlled. We introduce a checklist of information that needs to be provided in order to ensure that a published study can be reproduced. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objectives: Manual systematic literature reviews are becoming increasingly challenging due to the sharp rise in publications. The primary objective of this literature review was to compare manual and computer software using artificial intelligence retrieval of publications on the cutaneous manifestations of primary SS, but we also evaluated the prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in primary SS. Methods: We compared manual searching and searching with the in-house computer software BIbliography BOT (BIBOT) designed for article retrieval and analysis. Both methods were used for a systematic literature review on a complex topic, i.e. the cutaneous manifestations of primary SS. Reproducibility was estimated by computing Cohen's κ coefficients and was interpreted as follows: slight, 0-0.20; fair, 0.21-0.40; moderate, 0.41-0.60; substantial, 0.61-0.80; and almost perfect, 0.81-1. Results: The manual search retrieved 855 articles and BIBOT 1042 articles. In all, 202 articles were then selected by applying exclusion criteria. Among them, 155 were retrieved by both methods, 33 by manual search only, and 14 by BIBOT only. Reliability (κ = 0.84) was almost perfect. Further selection was performed by reading the 202 articles. Cohort sizes and the nature and prevalence of cutaneous manifestations varied across publications. In all, we found 52 cutaneous manifestations reported in primary SS patients. The most described ones were cutaneous vasculitis (561 patients), xerosis (651 patients) and annular erythema (215 patients). Conclusion: Among the final selection of 202 articles, 155/202 (77%) were found by the two methods but BIBOT was faster and automatically classified the articles in a chart. Combining the two methods retrieved the largest number of publications. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology.

N2  - Objective: Article full texts are often inaccessible via the standard search engines of biomedical literature, such as PubMed and Embase, which are commonly used for systematic reviews. Excluding the full-text bodies from a literature search may result in a small or selective subset of articles being included in the review because of the limited information that is available in only title, abstract, and keywords. This article describes a comparison of search strategies based on a systematic literature review of all articles published in 5 top-ranked epidemiology journals between 2000 and 2017. Study Design and Setting: Based on a text-mining approach, we studied how nine different methodological topics were mentioned across text fields (title, abstract, keywords, and text body). The following methodological topics were studied: propensity score methods, inverse probability weighting, marginal structural modeling, multiple imputation, Kaplan-Meier estimation, number needed to treat, measurement error, randomized controlled trial, and latent class analysis. Results: In total, 31,641 Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files were downloaded from the journals’ websites. For all methodological topics and journals, at most 50% of articles with a mention of a topic in the text body also mentioned the topic in the title, abstract, or keywords. For several topics, a gradual decrease over calendar time was observed of reporting in the title, abstract, or keywords. Conclusion: Literature searches based on title, abstract, and keywords alone may not be sufficiently sensitive for studies of epidemiological research practice. This study also illustrates the potential value of full-text literature searches, provided there is accessibility of full-text bodies for literature searches. © 2020 The Authors

N2  - Background: Comprehensive literature searches are conducted over multiple medical databases in order to meet stringent quality standards for systematic reviews. These searches are often very laborious, with authors often manually screening thousands of articles. Information retrieval (IR) techniques have proven increasingly effective in improving the efficiency of this process. IR challenges for systematic reviews involve building classifiers using training data with very high class-imbalance, and meeting the requirement for near perfect recall on relevant studies. Traditionally, most systematic reviews have focused on questions relating to treatment. The last decade has seen a large increase in the number of systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA). Objective: We aim to demonstrate that DTA reviews comprise an especially challenging subclass of systematic reviews with respect to the workload required for literature screening. We identify specific challenges for the application of IR to literature screening for DTA reviews, and identify potential directions for future research. Methods: We hypothesize that IR for DTA reviews face three additional challenges, compared to systematic reviews of treatments. These include an increased class-imbalance, a broader definition of the target class, and relative inadequacy of available metadata (ie, medical subject headings (MeSH) terms for medical literature analysis and retrieval system online). Assuming these hypotheses to be true, we identify five manifestations when we compare literature searches of DTA versus treatment. These manifestations include: An increase in the average number of articles screened, and increase in the average number of full-text articles obtained, a decrease in the number of included studies as a percentage of full-text articles screened, a decrease in the number of included studies as a percentage of all articles screened, and a decrease in the number of full-text articles obtained as a percentage of all articles screened. As of July 12 2013, 13 published Cochrane DTA reviews were available and all were included. For each DTA review, we randomly selected 15 treatment reviews published by the corresponding Cochrane Review Group (N=195). We then statistically tested differences in these five hypotheses, for the DTA versus treatment reviews. Results: Despite low statistical power caused by the small sample size for DTA reviews, strong (P<.01) or very strong (P<.001) evidence was obtained to support three of the five expected manifestations, with evidence for at least one manifestation of each hypothesis. The observed difference in effect sizes are substantial, demonstrating the practical difference in reviewer workload. Conclusions: Reviewer workload (volume of citations screened) when screening literature for systematic reviews of DTA is especially high. This corresponds to greater rates of class-imbalance when training classifiers for automating literature screening for DTA reviews. Addressing concerns such as lower quality metadata and effectively modelling the broader target class could help to alleviate such challenges, providing possible directions for future research. © 2014 JMIR Publications Inc.

N2  - Objectives: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Automated extraction of quantitative data from primary studies can accelerate this process. ClinicalTrials.gov, launched in 2000, is the world's largest trial repository of results data from clinical trials; it has been used as a source instead of journal articles. We have developed a Web application called EXACT (EXtracting Accurate efficacy and safety information from ClinicalTrials.gov) that allows users without advanced programming skills to automatically extract data from ClinicalTrials.gov in analysis-ready format. We have also used the automatically extracted data to examine the reproducibility of meta-analyses in three published systematic reviews. Study Design and Setting: We developed a Python-based software application (EXACT) that automatically extracts data required for meta-analysis from the ClinicalTrials.gov database in a spreadsheet format. We confirmed the accuracy of the extracted data and then used those data to repeat meta-analyses in three published systematic reviews. To ensure that we used the same statistical methods and outcomes as the published systematic reviews, we repeated the meta-analyses using data manually extracted from the relevant journal articles. For the outcomes whose results we were able to reproduce using those journal article data, we examined the usability of ClinicalTrials.gov data. Results: EXACT extracted data at ClincalTrials.gov with 100% accuracy, and it required 60% less time than the usual practice of manually extracting data from journal articles. We found that 87% of the data elements extracted using EXACT matched those extracted manually from the journal articles. We were able to reproduce 24 of 28 outcomes using the journal article data. Of these 24 outcomes, we were able to reproduce 83.3% of the published estimates using data at ClinicalTrials.gov. Conclusion: EXACT (http://bio-nlp.org/EXACT) automatically and accurately extracted data elements from ClinicalTrials.gov and thus reduced time in data extraction. The ClinicalTrials.gov data reproduced most meta-analysis results in our study, but this conclusion needs further validation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - This research aims to illustrate the potential use of concepts, techniques, and mining process tools to improve the systematic review process. Thus, a review was performed on two online databases (Scopus and ISI Web of Science) from 2012 to 2019. A total of 9649 studies were identified, which were analyzed using probabilistic topic modeling procedures within a machine learning approach. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation method, chosen for modeling, required the following stages: 1) data cleansing, and 2) data modeling into topics for coherence and perplexity analysis. All research was conducted according to the standards of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses in a fully computerized way. The computational literature review is an integral part of a broader literature review process. The results presented met three criteria: (1) literature review for a research area, (2) analysis and classification of journals, and (3) analysis and classification of academic and individual research teams. The contribution of the article is to demonstrate how the publication network is formed in this particular field of research, and how the content of abstracts can be automatically analyzed to provide a set of research topics for quick understanding and application in future projects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

N2  - Hypothesis generation is a critical step in research and a cornerstone in the rare disease field. Research is most efficient when those hypotheses are based on the entirety of knowledge known to date. Systematic review articles are commonly used in biomedicine to summarize existing knowledge and contextualize experimental data. But the information contained within review articles is typically only expressed as free-text, which is difficult to use computationally. Researchers struggle to navigate, collect and remix prior knowledge as it is scattered in several silos without seamless integration and access. This lack of a structured information framework hinders research by both experimental and computational scientists. To better organize knowledge and data, we built a structured review article that is specifically focused on NGLY1 Deficiency, an ultra-rare genetic disease first reported in 2012. We represented this structured review as a knowledge graph and then stored this knowledge graph in a Neo4j database to simplify dissemination, querying and visualization of the network. Relative to free-text, this structured review better promotes the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR). In collaboration with domain experts in NGLY1 Deficiency, we demonstrate how this resource can improve the efficiency and comprehensiveness of hypothesis generation. We also developed a read-write interface that allows domain experts to contribute FAIR structured knowledge to this community resource. In contrast to traditional free-text review articles, this structured review exists as a living knowledge graph that is curated by humans and accessible to computational analyses. Finally, we have generalized this workflow into modular and repurposable components that can be applied to other domain areas. This NGLY1 Deficiency-focused network is publicly available at http://ngly1graph.org/. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.

N2  - This article conducts a literature review of current and future challenges in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in cyber physical systems. The literature review is focused on identifying a conceptual framework for increasing resilience with AI through automation supporting both, a technical and human level. The methodology applied resembled a literature review and taxonomic analysis of complex internet of things (IoT) interconnected and coupled cyber physical systems. There is an increased attention on propositions on models, infrastructures and frameworks of IoT in both academic and technical papers. These reports and publications frequently represent a juxtaposition of other related systems and technologies (e.g. Industrial Internet of Things, Cyber Physical Systems, Industry 4.0 etc.). We review academic and industry papers published between 2010 and 2020. The results determine a new hierarchical cascading conceptual framework for analysing the evolution of AI decision-making in cyber physical systems. We argue that such evolution is inevitable and autonomous because of the increased integration of connected devices (IoT) in cyber physical systems. To support this argument, taxonomic methodology is adapted and applied for transparency and justifications of concepts selection decisions through building summary maps that are applied for designing the hierarchical cascading conceptual framework. © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Technology-enhanced learning (TEL) continues to grow gradually while considering a multitude of factors, which underpins the need to develop a TEL maturity assessment as a guideline for this gradual improvement. This study investigates the potential application of TEL’s expert knowledge presented in various research articles as qualitative data for developing assessment questionnaires. A mixed-method approach is applied to analyze the qualitative data using systematic literature review (SLR) with automated content analysis (ACA) as quantitative data processing to strengthen the trustworthiness of the findings and reduce researcher bias. This process is carried out six steps: conducting SLR, data processing with ACA using Leximancer, organizing resulting concepts with facet analysis, contextualizing each TEL facet, constructing the assessment questionnaire for each context, and establishing TEL maturity dimensions. This study generates 64 questionnaire statements grouped according to the target respondents, namely students, teachers, or institutions. This set of questions is also grouped into dimensions representing aligned context: student performance, learning process, applied technology, contents, accessibility, teachers and teachings, strategy and regulation. Further research is required to distribute this questionnaire for pilot respondents to design the improvement roadmap and check data patterns to formulate maturity appraisals and scoring methods © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

N2  - Background: Citation screening for scoping searches and rapid review is time-consuming and inefficient, often requiring days or sometimes months to complete. We examined the reliability of PICo-based title-only screening using keyword searches based on the PICo elements-Participants, Interventions, and Comparators, but not the Outcomes. Methods: A convenience sample of 10 datasets, derived from the literature searches of completed systematic reviews, was used to test PICo-based title-only screening. Search terms for screening were generated from the inclusion criteria of each review, specifically the PICo elements-Participants, Interventions and Comparators. Synonyms for the PICo terms were sought, including alternatives for clinical conditions, trade names of generic drugs and abbreviations for clinical conditions, interventions and comparators. The MeSH database, Wikipedia, Google searches and online thesauri were used to assist generating terms. Title-only screening was performed by five reviewers independently in Endnote X7 reference management software using OR Boolean operator. Outcome measures were recall of included studies and the reduction in screening effort. Recall is the proportion of included studies retrieved using PICo title-only screening out of the total number of included studies in the original reviews. The percentage reduction in screening effort is the proportion of records not needing screening because the method eliminates them from the screen set. Results: Across the 10 reviews, the reduction in screening effort ranged from 11 to 78% with a median reduction of 53%. In nine systematic reviews, the recall of included studies was 100%. In one review (oxygen therapy), four of five reviewers missed the same included study (median recall 67%). A post hoc analysis was performed on the dataset with the lowest reduction in screening effort (11%), and it was rescreened using only the intervention and comparator keywords and omitting keywords for participants. The reduction in screening effort increased to 57%, and the recall of included studies was maintained (100%). Conclusions: In this sample of datasets, PICo-based title-only screening was able to expedite citation screening for scoping searches and rapid reviews by reducing the number of citations needed to screen but requires a thorough workup of the potential synonyms and alternative terms. Further research which evaluates the feasibility of this technique with heterogeneous datasets in different fields would be useful to inform the generalisability of this technique. © 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Policy makers need access to reliable data to monitor and evaluate the progress of development outcomes and targets such as sustainable development outcomes (SDGs). However, significant data and evidence gaps remain. Lack of resources, limited capacity within governments and logistical difficulties in collecting data are some of the reasons for the data gaps. Big data—that is digitally generated, passively produced and automatically collected—offers a great potential for answering some of the data needs. Satellite and sensors, mobile phone call detail records, online transactions and search data, and social media are some of the examples of big data. Integrating big data with the traditional household surveys and administrative data can complement data availability, quality, granularity, accuracy and frequency, and help measure development outcomes temporally and spatially in a number of new ways.The study maps different sources of big data onto development outcomes (based on SDGs) to identify current evidence base, use and the gaps. The map provides a visual overview of existing and ongoing studies. This study also discusses the risks, biases and ethical challenges in using big data for measuring and evaluating development outcomes. The study is a valuable resource for evaluators, researchers, funders, policymakers and practitioners in their effort to contributing to evidence informed policy making and in achieving the SDGs. Objectives: Identify and appraise rigorous impact evaluations (IEs), systematic reviews and the studies that have innovatively used big data to measure any development outcomes with special reference to difficult contexts. Search Methods: A number of general and specialised data bases and reporsitories of organisations were searched using keywords related to big data by an information specialist. Selection Criteria: The studies were selected on basis of whether they used big data sources to measure or evaluate development outcomes. Data Collection and Analysis: Data collection was conducted using a data extraction tool and all extracted data was entered into excel and then analysed using Stata. The data analysis involved looking at trends and descriptive statistics only. Main Results: The search yielded over 17,000 records, which we then screened down to 437 studies which became the foundation of our systematic map. We found that overall, there is a sizable and rapidly growing number of measurement studies using big data but a much smaller number of IEs. We also see that the bulk of the big data sources are machine-generated (mostly satellites) represented in the light blue. We find that satellite data was used in over 70% of the measurement studies and in over 80% of the IEs. Authors' Conclusions: This map gives us a sense that there is a lot of work being done to develop appropriate measures using big data which could subsequently be used in IEs. Information on costs, ethics, transparency is lacking in the studies and more work is needed in this area to understand the efficacies related to the use of big data. There are a number of outcomes which are not being studied using big data, either due to the lack to applicability such as education or due to lack of awareness about the new methods and data sources. The map points to a number of gaps as well as opportunities where future researchers can conduct research. © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Background: The exponential growth of the biomedical literature necessitates investigating strategies to reduce systematic reviewer burden while maintaining the high standards of systematic review validity and comprehensiveness. Methods: We compared the traditional systematic review screening process with (1) a review-of-reviews (ROR) screening approach and (2) a semi-automation screening approach using two publicly available tools (RobotAnalyst and AbstrackR) and different types of training sets (randomly selected citations subjected to dual-review at the title-abstract stage, highly curated citations dually reviewed at the full-text stage, and a combination of the two). We evaluated performance measures of sensitivity, specificity, missed citations, and workload burden Results: The ROR approach for treatments of early-stage prostate cancer had a poor sensitivity (0.54) and studies missed by the ROR approach tended to be of head-to-head comparisons of active treatments, observational studies, and outcomes of physical harms and quality of life. Title and abstract screening incorporating semi-automation only resulted in a sensitivity of 100% at high levels of reviewer burden (review of 99% of citations). A highly curated, smaller-sized, training set (n = 125) performed similarly to a larger training set of random citations (n = 938). Conclusion: Two approaches to rapidly update SRs—review-of-reviews and semi-automation—failed to demonstrate reduced workload burden while maintaining an acceptable level of sensitivity. We suggest careful evaluation of the ROR approach through comparison of inclusion criteria and targeted searches to fill evidence gaps as well as further research of semi-automation use, including more study of highly curated training sets. © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Adherence to medication in long-term conditions is around 50%. The key components of successful interventions to improve medication adherence remain unclear, particularly when examined over prolonged follow-up periods. Behaviour change theories are increasingly interested in the utility of habit formation for the maintenance of health behaviour change, but there is no documentation on how habit has been conceptualised in the medication adherence intervention literature, or what effect the key technique identified in habit formation theory (context dependent repetition) has in these studies. To examine this, a machine-learning assisted review was conducted. Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PSYCInfo and the reference list of a comprehensive systematic review of medication adherence interventions yielded 5973 articles. Machine learning-assisted title and abstract screening identified 15 independent RCTs published between 1976 and 2021, including 18 intervention comparisons of interest. Key findings indicate that conceptualisations of habit in the medication adherence literature are varied and behaviour change technique coding identified only six studies which explicitly described using habit formation. Future work should aim to develop this evidence base, drawing on contemporary habit theory and with explicit demonstration of what techniques have been used to promote habit formation. © 2022 The Author(s).

N2  - Can, and should, artificial intelligence (AI) and its machine learning (ML) variant be applied to study scholarly literature? With AI and ML rapidly disrupting industries, we investigate how scholars in entrepreneurship and small business management can capitalize on AI and ML to support their scholarship and comprehensively review, catalog, and analyze the literature. We examine various ML tools and deploy these tools against a published literature review to consider whether ML complements or substitutes scholars’ agency. We show that ML can reinforce human findings to support replicability and robustness, adding additional layers of transparency and validity to conclusions from human-derived systematic reviews. Our contributions provide scholars with valuable guidance and a blueprint for adopting ML into their scholarship and not replacing their scholarship. © 2021 International Council for Small Business.

PY  - 2018
PD  - 
N2  - Systematic reviews are an increasingly popular decision-making tool that provides an unbiased summary of evidence to support conservation action. These reviews bridge the gap between researchers and managers by presenting a comprehensive overview of all studies relating to a particular topic and identify specifically where and under which conditions an effect is present. However, several technical challenges can severely hinder the feasibility and applicability of systematic reviews, for example, homonyms (terms that share spelling but differ in meaning). Homonyms add noise to search results and cannot be easily identified or removed. We developed a semiautomated approach that can aid in the classification of homonyms among narratives. We used a combination of automated content analysis and artificial neural networks to quickly and accurately sift through large corpora of academic texts and classify them to distinct topics. As an example, we explored the use of the word reintroduction in academic texts. Reintroduction is used within the conservation context to indicate the release of organisms to their former native habitat; however, a Web of Science search for this word returned thousands of publications in which the term has other meanings and contexts. Using our method, we automatically classified a sample of 3000 of these publications with over 99% accuracy, relative to a manual classification. Our approach can be used easily with other homonyms and can greatly facilitate systematic reviews or similar work in which homonyms hinder the harnessing of large text corpora. Beyond homonyms we see great promise in combining automated content analysis and machine-learning methods to handle and screen big data for relevant information in conservation science. © 2017 Society for Conservation Biology

N2  - Background: With the substantial growth in the biomedical research literature, a larger number of claims are published daily, some of which seemingly disagree with or contradict prior claims on the same topics. Resolving such contradictions is critical to advancing our understanding of human disease and developing effective treatments. Automated text analysis techniques can facilitate such analysis by extracting claims from the literature, flagging those that are potentially contradictory, and identifying any study characteristics that may explain such contradictions. Methods: Using SemMedDB, our own PubMed-scale repository of semantic predications (subject-relation-object triples), we identified apparent contradictions in the biomedical research literature and developed a categorization of contextual characteristics that explain such contradictions. Clinically relevant semantic predications relating to 20 diseases and involving opposing predicate pairs (e.g., an intervention TREATS or CAUSES a disease) were retrieved from SemMedDB. After addressing inference, uncertainty, generic concepts, and NLP errors through automatic and manual filtering steps, a set of apparent contradictions were identified and characterized. Results: We retrieved 117,676 predication instances from 62,360 PubMed abstracts (Jan 1980-Dec 2016). From these instances, automatic filtering steps generated 2236 candidate contradictory pairs. Through manual analysis, we determined that 58 of these pairs (2.6%) were apparent contradictions. We identified five main categories of contextual characteristics that explain these contradictions: (a) internal to the patient, (b) external to the patient, (c) endogenous/exogenous, (d) known controversy, and (e) contradictions in literature. Categories (a) and (b) were subcategorized further (e.g., species, dosage) and accounted for the bulk of the contradictory information. Conclusions: Semantic predications, by accounting for lexical variability, and SemMedDB, owing to its literature scale, can support identification and elucidation of potentially contradictory claims across the biomedical domain. Further filtering and classification steps are needed to distinguish among them the true contradictory claims. The ability to detect contradictions automatically can facilitate important biomedical knowledge management tasks, such as tracking and verifying scientific claims, summarizing research on a given topic, identifying knowledge gaps, and assessing evidence for systematic reviews, with potential benefits to the scientific community. Future work will focus on automating these steps for fully automatic recognition of contradictions from the biomedical research literature. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of technological pillars of Industry 4.0 based on knowledge to adopt the supply chain performance of Thai small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 4.0. In addition, to increase knowledge and understanding of how to apply knowledge in technology 4.0 to improve the efficiency of supply chains and organizations. Design/methodology/approach: An integrated model was developed from applying knowledge in five technological pillars of Industry 4.0 such as Internet of things (IoTs), cloud computing, big data and analytics, additive manufacturing and cyber-security. The bibliometric analysis was used to find the relationship between the technological pillars of Industry 4.0 and the literature review. The survey questionnaires were sent to Thai SME 4.0 (manufacturing aspect). Of these, 240 useable responses were received, resulting in a response rate of 65.84%, after then, the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), structural equation modeling (SEM) and validity were used to evaluate the model through IBM SPSS 21 and AMOS 22. Findings: EFA showed the four groups of the technological pillars of Industry 4.0, such as support human, automation, real-time and security. These groups positively impact supply chain performance (increase delivery reliability, increase resource efficiency, decrease costs in the supply chain and reduce delivery time). Another important finding is that supply chain performance positively impacts organizational performance in profitability, return on investment (ROI) and sale growth. Originality/value: This study is a model development to support the supply chain performance and increase understanding related to applying knowledge in technology 4.0 that remains unclear for SME 4.0. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Systematic reviews are comprehensive literature reviews that target a highly focused research question. In the medical domain, complex Boolean queries are used to identify studies. To ensure comprehensiveness, all studies retrieved are screened for inclusion or exclusion in the review. Developing Boolean queries for this task requires the expertise of trained information specialists. However, even for these expert searchers, query formulation can be difficult and lengthy: especially when dealing with areas of medicine that they may not be knowledgeable about. To this end, two computational adaptations of methods information specialists use to formulate Boolean queries have been proposed in prior work. These adaptations can be used to assist information specialists by providing a good starting point for query development. However, a number of limitations with these computational methods have been raised, and a comparison between them has not been made. In this study, we address the limitations of previous work and evaluate the two. We found that, between the two computational adaptions, the objective method is more effective than the conceptual method for query formulation alone, however, the conceptual method provides a better starting point for manual query refinement. This work helps to inform those building search tools that assist with systematic review construction. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

N2  - Background: The reliable and usable (semi)automation of data extraction can support the field of systematic review by reducing the workload required to gather information about the conduct and results of the included studies. This living systematic review examines published approaches for data extraction from reports of clinical studies. Methods: We systematically and continually search MEDLINE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), arXiv, and the dblp computer science bibliography databases. Full text screening and data extraction are conducted within an open-source living systematic review application created for the purpose of this review. This iteration of the living review includes publications up to a cut-off date of 22 April 2020. Results: In total, 53 publications are included in this version of our review. Of these, 41 (77%) of the publications addressed extraction of data from abstracts, while 14 (26%) used full texts. A total of 48 (90%) publications developed and evaluated classifiers that used randomised controlled trials as the main target texts. Over 30 entities were extracted, with PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) being the most frequently extracted. A description of their datasets was provided by 49 publications (94%), but only seven (13%) made the data publicly available. Code was made available by 10 (19%) publications, and five (9%) implemented publicly available tools. Conclusions: This living systematic review presents an overview of (semi)automated data-extraction literature of interest to different types of systematic review. We identified a broad evidence base of publications describing data extraction for interventional reviews and a small number of publications extracting epidemiological or diagnostic accuracy data. The lack of publicly available gold-standard data for evaluation, and lack of application thereof, makes it difficult to draw conclusions on which is the best-performing system for each data extraction target. With this living review we aim to review the literature continually. © 2021 Schmidt L et al.

N2  - Launching biomedical innovations based on clinical demands instead of translating basic research findings to practice reduces the risk that the results will not fit the clinical routine. To realize this type of innovation, a meta‐analysis of the body of research is necessary to reveal demand‐matching concepts. However, both the data deluge and the narrow time constraints for innovation make it impossible to perform such reviews manually. Thus, this paper proposes a specifically adapted “Potential Technologies Review” approach focusing on automated text mining and information retrieval techniques. The novel framework combines features from both systematic and scoping reviews. It aims at high coverage and reproducibility while mapping technologies—even with a fuzzy initial scope. To achieve these goals for search and triage, a set of closely interrelated methods has been developed: (a) automated query optimization, (b) screening prioritization, and (c) recall estimation. To determine appropriate parameters, a variety of published literature corpora were used and compared with an evaluation on a real‐world dataset. Our results show that it is feasible to automate the identification of relevant works using this newly introduced framework. It achieved a workload reduction of up to 91% “Work‐saved‐over Sampling (WSS)” with a 76% overall recall compared with manually screening search results. Reducing the workload is a prerequisite for a rapid Potential Technologies Review when conducting demand‐pull innovations. Moreover, it facilitates the updating and closer monitoring of latest findings. Studying the robustness of the framework and expanding it to patent documents are future tasks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - To generate a parsimonious gene set for understanding the mechanisms underlying complex diseases, we reasoned it was necessary to combine the curation of public literature, review of experimental databases and interpolation of pathway-associated genes. Using this strategy, we previously built the following two databases for reproductive disorders: The Database for Preterm Birth (dbPTB) and The Database for Preeclampsia (dbPEC). The completeness and accuracy of these databases is essential for supporting our understanding of these complex conditions. Given the exponential increase in biomedical literature, it is becoming increasingly difficult to manually maintain these databases. Using our curated databases as reference data sets, we implemented a machine learning-based approach to optimize article selection for manual curation. We used logistic regression, random forests and neural networks as our machine learning algorithms to classify articles. We examined features derived from abstract text, annotations and metadata that we hypothesized would best classify articles with genetically relevant content associated to the disorder of interest. Combinations of these features were used build the classifiers and the performance of these feature sets were compared to a standard 'Bag-of-Words'. Several combinations of these genetic based feature sets outperformed 'Bag-of-Words' at a threshold such that 95% of the curated gene set obtained from the original manual curation of all articles were extracted from the articles classified by machine learning as 'considered'. The performance was superior in terms of the reduction of required manual curation and two measures of the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The reduction in workload ranged from 0.814 to 0.846 for the dbPTB and 0.301 to 0.371 for the dbPEC. Additionally, a database of metadata and annotations is generated which allows for rapid query of individual features. Our results demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can identify articles with relevant data for databases of genes associated with complex diseases. © The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - Background/Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare sector is receiving attention from researchers and health professionals. Few previous studies have investigated this topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision sciences and health professions. Methods: The structured literature review with its reliable and replicable research protocol allowed the researchers to extract 288 peer-reviewed papers from Scopus. The authors used qualitative and quantitative variables to analyse authors, journals, keywords, and collaboration networks among researchers. Additionally, the paper benefited from the Bibliometrix R software package. Results: The investigation showed that the literature in this field is emerging. It focuses on health services management, predictive medicine, patient data and diagnostics, and clinical decision-making. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom contributed the highest number of studies. Keyword analysis revealed that AI can support physicians in making a diagnosis, predicting the spread of diseases and customising treatment paths. Conclusions: The literature reveals several AI applications for health services and a stream of research that has not fully been covered. For instance, AI projects require skills and data quality awareness for data-intensive analysis and knowledge-based management. Insights can help researchers and health professionals understand and address future research on AI in the healthcare field. © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - This descriptive study analyzed 1849 international and 212 Korean studies to explore the main topics of nursing research on accidental falls. We extracted only nouns from each abstract, and four topics were identified through topic modeling, which were divided into aspects of fall prevention and its consequences. “Fall prevention program and scale” is popular among studies on the validity of fall risk assessment tools and the development of exercise and education programs. “Nursing strategy for fall prevention” is common in studies on nurse education programs and practice guidelines to improve the quality of patient safety care. “Hospitalization by fall injury” is used in studies about delayed discharge, increased costs, and deaths of subjects with fall risk factors hospitalized at medical institutions due to fall-related injuries. “Long-term care facility falls” is popular in studies about interventions to prevent fall injuries that occur in conjunction with dementia in long-term care facilities. It is necessary to establish a system and policy for fall prevention in Korean medical institutions. This study confirms the trends in domestic and international fall-related research, suggesting the need for studies to address insufficient fall-related policies and systems and translational research to be applied in clinical trials. © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - The scientific literature on climate change adaptation has become too large to assess manually. Beyond standard scientometrics, questions about if and how the field is progressing thus remain largely unanswered. Here we provide a novel, inquisitive, computer-assisted evidence mapping methodology that combines expert interviews (n = 26) and structural topic modelling to evaluate open-ended research questions on progress in the field. We apply this to 62 191 adaptation-relevant scientific publications (1988-2020), selected through supervised machine learning from a comprehensive climate change query. Comparing the literature to key benchmarks of mature adaptation research, our findings align with trends in the adaptation literature observed by most experts: the field is maturing, growing rapidly, and diversifying, with social science and implementation topics arising next to the still-dominant natural sciences and impacts-focused research. Formally assessing the representativeness of IPCC citations, we find evidence of a delay effect for fast-growing areas of research like adaptation strategies and governance. Similarly, we show significant topic biases by geographic location: especially disaster and development-related topics are often studied in Southern countries by authors from the North, while Northern countries dominate governance topics. Moreover, there is a general paucity of research in some highly vulnerable countries. Experts lastly signal a need for meaningful stakeholder involvement. Expanding on the methods presented here would aid the comprehensive and transparent monitoring of adaptation research. For the evidence synthesis community, our methodology provides an example of how to move beyond the descriptive towards the inquisitive and formally evaluating research questions. © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - This article provides a comprehensive literature review and classification method for data mining techniques applied to academic libraries. To achieve this, forty-one practical contributions over the period 1998-2014 were identified and reviewed for their direct relevance. Each article was categorized according to the main data mining functions: clustering, association, classification, and regression; and their application in the four main library aspects: services, quality, collection, and usage behavior. Findings indicate that both collection and usage behavior analyses have received most of the research attention, especially related to collection development and usability of websites and online services respectively. Furthermore, classification and regression models are the two most commonly used data mining functions applied in library settings.Additionally, results indicate that the top 6 journals of articles published on the application of data mining techniques in academic libraries are: College and Research Libraries, Journal of Academic Librarianship, Information Processing and Management, Library Hi Tech, International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change Management, and The Electronic Library. Scopus is the multidisciplinary database that provides the best coverage of journal articles identified. To our knowledge, this study represents the first systematic, identifiable and comprehensive academic literature review of data mining techniques applied to academic libraries. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Smart aging is an emerging research topic that has a profound impact on society and well-being of aging population. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no systematic analysis of grasping what research has been conducted on smart aging. Thus, there is no discussion of major issues and future directions of smart aging. In this paper, we provide an overview of smart aging in three ways: 1) to synthesize the components of smart aging based on the comprehensive literature review, 2) to examine the range of topics extracted from 3760 web pages and 3) to analyze the research activities on smart aging by conducting a content analysis of 4500 web pages of the NIH funded organizations' websites related to smart aging. The results of the comprehensive literature review indicate that the discussions on smart aging in the scientific publications are by and large classified into the following three directions: Technologies, Aging Medical Care, and Behavior and Social. In addition, the major topics from search engine datasets, which echoes more general discussions from various different parties, are related to entertainment program and social media, along with medical science and innovation technologies, whereas the research activities of NIH funded organizations focused on cross-disciplinary research in Behavioral and Social science, and Medical Care. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - This research provides an overview on horticulture innovations in the last decade through a literature review and the use of a computer qualitative data analysis. We used Leximancer text mining software to identify concepts, themes and pathways linked with horticulture innovations. The software tool enabled us to “zoom out” to gain a broad perspective of the pooled data, and it indicated which studies clustered around the dominant topic. It displays the extracted information in a visual form, to wit, an interactive concept map, which summaries the interconnected themes and demonstrates any interdependencies. The text mining analysis revealed that the themes strongly related to “innovation” are “water”, “urban”, “system”, “countries” and “technology”. The outputs identified have been interpreted to discover meaning from the content analysis, since the software can facilitate a comprehensive and transparent data coding but cannot replace researcher’s interpretive work. Furthermore, we focused on the diffusion and the barriers for the spread of innovation, pointing out the differences about developing and advanced countries. This analysis allows the researcher to have a holistic understanding of the examination area and could lead to further studies. © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Background: The grades of recommendation, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach is widely implemented in systematic reviews, health technology assessment and guideline development organisations throughout the world. A key advantage to this approach is that it aids transparency regarding judgments on the quality of evidence. However, the intricacies of making judgments about research methodology and evidence make the GRADE system complex and challenging to apply without training. Methods: We have developed a semi-automated quality assessment tool (SAQAT) l based on GRADE. This is informed by responses by reviewers to checklist questions regarding characteristics that may lead to unreliability. These responses are then entered into the Bayesian network to ascertain the probabilities of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias conditional on review characteristics. The model then combines these probabilities to provide a probability for each of the GRADE overall quality categories. We tested the model using a range of plausible scenarios that guideline developers or review authors could encounter. Results: Overall, the model reproduced GRADE judgements for a range of scenarios. Potential advantages over standard assessment are use of explicit and consistent weightings for different review characteristics, forcing consideration of important but sometimes neglected characteristics and principled downgrading where small but important probabilities of downgrading are accrued across domains. Conclusions: Bayesian networks have considerable potential for use as tools to assess the validity of research evidence. The key strength of such networks lies in the provision of a statistically coherent method for combining probabilities across a complex framework based on both belief and evidence. In addition to providing tools for less experienced users to implement reliability assessment, the potential for sensitivity analyses and automation may be beneficial for application and the methodological development of reliability tools. © 2015 Stewart et al.

N2  - Background: Clinical trial registries can be used to monitor the production of trial evidence and signal when systematic reviews become out of date. However, this use has been limited to date due to the extensive manual review required to search for and screen relevant trial registrations. Our aim was to evaluate a new method that could partially automate the identification of trial registrations that may be relevant for systematic review updates. Materials and methods: We identified 179 systematic reviews of drug interventions for type 2 diabetes, which included 537 clinical trials that had registrations in ClinicalTrials.gov. Text from the trial registrations were used as features directly, or transformed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We tested a novel matrix factorisation approach that uses a shared latent space to learn how to rank relevant trial registrations for each systematic review, comparing the performance to document similarity to rank relevant trial registrations. The two approaches were tested on a holdout set of the newest trials from the set of type 2 diabetes systematic reviews and an unseen set of 141 clinical trial registrations from 17 updated systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The performance was measured by the number of relevant registrations found after examining 100 candidates (recall@100) and the median rank of relevant registrations in the ranked candidate lists. Results: The matrix factorisation approach outperformed the document similarity approach with a median rank of 59 (of 128,392 candidate registrations in ClinicalTrials.gov) and recall@100 of 60.9% using LDA feature representation, compared to a median rank of 138 and recall@100 of 42.8% in the document similarity baseline. In the second set of systematic reviews and their updates, the highest performing approach used document similarity and gave a median rank of 67 (recall@100 of 62.9%). Conclusions: A shared latent space matrix factorisation method was useful for ranking trial registrations to reduce the manual workload associated with finding relevant trials for systematic review updates. The results suggest that the approach could be used as part of a semi-automated pipeline for monitoring potentially new evidence for inclusion in a review update. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive research and to develop a model to predict the loan defaults. This kind of models becomes inevitable as the issue of bad loans are very much critical in the financial sector especially in micro financing banks of various underdeveloped and developed countries. To cope up with this problem a comprehensive literature review was done to study the significant factors that leads to this issue. Moreover, these reviewed studies were critically focused towards applying data mining techniques for the prediction and classification of the loan defaults. This study used methodologies named KDD, CRISP-DM and SEMMA. While in the experimentation phase, three different data mining techniques were applied for the proposed model and their performances were evaluated on various parameters. Based on these parameters, the best method was selected, explained and suggested because of its significant characteristics regarding the prediction of the loan defaults in the financial sector. © 2019 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

N2  - The central role of information systems review articles has been recognised in a recent explosion of interest in editorials, research articles, and opinion papers investigating methods and approaches for conducting standalone reviews. In continuity with recent developments in this area, this descriptive review seeks to determine the extent to which various types of review articles published in our field are transparent, i.e., they report important methodological elements about their design. To fulfil this objective, we identified, classified, and coded 142 review articles from the Association for Information Systems (AIS) senior scholars’ basket of journals published between 2000 and 2014. Overall, our findings indicate inadequate reporting of the methods, procedures, and techniques used in a majority of reviews. Our assessment also reveals that theory development and narrative reviews, which are the most frequently published types of reviews in our field, generally were the least explicit with regard to the methods they used. Based on our observations, we recommend that authors of all forms of reviews better document design decisions so to increase trustworthiness, get meaningful results, and develop a cumulative body of knowledge in our discipline. The list of reporting items developed in this study can serve as a framework to assist prospective authors of reviews both within and outside our field. © 2017, © The Operational Research Society 2017.

N2  - The wide variety of readily available electronic media grants anyone the freedom to retrieve published references from almost any area of research around the world. Despite this privilege, keeping up with primary research evidence is almost impossible because of the increase in professional publishing across disciplines. Systematic reviews are a solution to this problem as they aim to synthesize all current information on a particular topic and present a balanced and unbiased summary of the findings. They are fast becoming an important method of research across a number of fields, yet only a small number of guidelines exist on how to define and select terms for a systematic search. This article presents a replicable method for selecting terms in a systematic search using the semantic concept recognition software called leximancer (Leximancer, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia). We use this software to construct a set of terms from a corpus of literature pertaining to transborder interventions for drug control and discuss the applicability of this method to systematic reviews in general. This method aims to contribute a more 'systematic' approach for selecting terms in a manner that is entirely replicable for any user. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Maintenance contributes to gaining high business performance, guarantees system availability and reliability as well as safe and sustainable operations. Maintenance activity effectiveness depends on competences and the skills of operators whose performance strongly affects maintenance and production operations. The research field of human issues in industrial maintenance was deeply addressed in the literature; however, the current industrial paradigm, which focusses on the integration of new technologies in conventional manufacturing operations to support human performance, sheds light on new challenges for enterprises and opportunities for research in this field. While some literature reviews in the field of human errors and human factors are available, no study investigated the main topics, research trends and challenges related to the role of maintenance operators in manufacturing systems. This paper addresses the current state-of-the-art role of maintenance operators in manufacturing systems, providing an overview of the main studies. A systematic literature review was carried out to identify significant papers. Then, a topic modelling algorithm was used to detect the main topics of the selected papers to provide the research trends of the subject. The identified topics provided interesting research insights on the human role in industrial maintenance. Research trends and further research opportunities were defined. © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Purpose: This article is based on a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on two-sided platforms, the business structure based on the concept of matchmaking groups of customers (e.g. Uber or Airbnb). The research aims to identify gaps in the existing literature while providing a structured summary of the existing knowledge in the field. Finally, we propose a conceptual framework enabling platform thinking, the ability to see hybrid multi-sided platforms as a useful resource-orchestration structure to unveil innovation opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a bibliometric approach, combing co-citation and text mining analyses of 196 papers, also implementing a longitudinal analysis that highlights the evolution of the field since its inception till today. Findings: The novel aspect of the paper consists in taking a purely managerial stance of a very peculiar kind of platform, merging existing knowledge in comprehensive frameworks while providing potential avenues for research. Research limitations/implications: From an academic perspective, this research highlights the double nature of two-sided platforms: as an operational choice or as a way to exploit (digital) assets and reach the economic sustainability. A research agenda is proposed, based on three pillars: a side-based standpoint, a business model perspective and an evolutionary stance to see how these businesses may evolve. Practical implications: The research identifies different literature streams that may help practitioners in identifying how two-sided platforms may help them in fostering innovation. Originality/value: The identification of two-sided platforms as a different way to create value (transaction platforms) or to capture value (non-transaction platform), enhancing the debate on this innovative business model. A research agenda to bring the field forward is proposed. © 2021, Daniel Trabucchi and Tommaso Buganza.

N2  - Novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a global threat to millions of lives. Enormous efforts in knowledge production have been made in the last few months, requiring a comprehensive analysis to examine the research gaps and to help guide an agenda for further studies. This study aims to explore the current research foci and their country variations regarding levels of income and COVID-19 transmission features. This textual analysis of 5780 publications extracted from the Web of Science, Medline, and Scopus databases was performed to explore the current research foci and propose further research agenda. The Latent Dirichlet allocation was used for topic modeling. Regression analysis was conducted to examine country variations in the research foci. Results indicate that publications are mainly contributed by the United States, China, and European countries. Guidelines for emergency care and surgical, viral pathogenesis, and global responses in the COVID-19 pandemic are the most common topics. There is variation in the research approaches to mitigate COVID-19 problems in countries with different income and transmission levels. Findings highlighted the need for global research collaborations among high-and low/middle-income countries in the different stages of pandemic prevention and control. © 2020 by the authors.

However, there is a lack of comprehensive reporting on the productivity, workflow, topics, and research landscape of AI in this field. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the global development of scientific publications and constructed interdisciplinary research topics on the theory and practice of AI in medicine from 1977 to 2018. Methods: We obtained bibliographic data and abstract contents of publications published between 1977 and 2018 from the Web of Science database. A total of 27,451 eligible articles were analyzed. Research topics were classified by latent Dirichlet allocation, and principal component analysis was used to identify the construct of the research landscape. Results: The applications of AI have mainly impacted clinical settings (enhanced prognosis and diagnosis, robot-assisted surgery, and rehabilitation), data science and precision medicine (collecting individual data for precision medicine), and policy making (raising ethical and legal issues, especially regarding privacy and confidentiality of data). However, AI applications have not been commonly used in resource-poor settings due to the limit in infrastructure and human resources. Conclusions: The application of AI in medicine has grown rapidly and focuses on three leading platforms: clinical practices, clinical material, and policies. AI might be one of the methods to narrow down the inequality in health care and medicine between developing and developed countries. Technology transfer and support from developed countries are essential measures for the advancement of AI application in health care in developing countries. © Bach Xuan Tran, Son Nghiem, Oz Sahin, Tuan Manh Vu, Giang Hai Ha, Giang Thu Vu, Hai Quang Pham, Hoa Thi Do, Carl A Latkin, Wilson Tam, Cyrus SH Ho, Roger CM Ho.

N2  - Responsible AI is concerned with the design, implementation and use of ethical, transparent, and accountable AI technology in order to reduce biases, promote fairness, equality, and to help facilitate interpretability and explainability of outcomes, which are particularly pertinent in a healthcare context. However, the extant literature on health AI reveals significant issues regarding each of the areas of responsible AI, posing moral and ethical consequences. This is particularly concerning in a health context where lives are at stake and where there are significant sensitivities that are not as pertinent in other domains outside of health. This calls for a comprehensive analysis of health AI using responsible AI concepts as a structural lens. A systematic literature review supported our data collection and sampling procedure, the corresponding analysis, and extraction of research themes helped us provide an evidence-based foundation. We contribute with a systematic description and explanation of the intellectual structure of Responsible AI in digital health and develop an agenda for future research. © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Motivation: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) annotates gene microarray data with functional information from the biomedical literature to improve gene-disease association prediction. We hypothesize that supplementing GSEA with comprehensive gene function catalogs built automatically using information extracted from the scientific literature will significantly enhance GSEA prediction quality. Methods: Gold standard gene sets for breast cancer (BrCa) and colorectal cancer (CRC) were derived from the literature. Two gene function catalogs (CMeSH and CUMLS) were automatically generated. 1. By using Entrez Gene to associate all recorded human genes with PubMed article IDs. 2. Using the genes mentioned in each PubMed article and associating each with the article's MeSH terms (in CMeSH) and extracted UMLS concepts (in CUMLS). Microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus for BrCa and CRC was then annotated using CMeSH and CUMLS and for comparison, also with several pre-existing catalogs (C2, C4 and C5 from the Molecular Signatures Database). Ranking was done using, a standard GSEA implementation (GSEA-p). Gene function predictions for enriched array data were evaluated against the gold standard by measuring area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Comparison of ranking using the literature enrichment catalogs, the pre-existing catalogs as well as five randomly generated catalogs show the literature derived enrichment catalogs are more effective. The AUC for BrCa using the unenriched gene expression dataset was 0.43, increasing to 0.89 after gene set enrichment with CUMLS. The AUC for CRC using the unenriched gene expression dataset was 0.54, increasing to 0.9 after enrichment with CMeSH. C2 increased AUC (BrCa 0.76, CRC 0.71) but C4 and C5 performed poorly (between 0.35 and 0.5). The randomly generated catalogs also performed poorly, equivalent to random guessing. Discussion: Gene set enrichment significantly improved prediction of gene-disease association. Selection of enrichment catalog had a substantial effect on prediction accuracy. The literature based catalogs performed better than the MSigDB catalogs, possibly because they are more recent. Catalogs generated automatically from the literature can be kept up to date. Conclusion: Prediction of gene-disease association is a fundamental task in biomedical research. GSEA provides a promising method when using literature-based enrichment catalogs.

N2  - Given the increasing academic interest in in-home consumption and the fragmented, multidisciplinary scholarly knowledge in this area, this study provides a first systematic effort to review and organize the literature on in-home service consumption. Using a hybrid systematic review, combining bibliometric and framework-based literature reviews, we identify four major thematic clusters (i.e., the meaning of home, home as a consumption hub, home healthcare services, and serving the elderly), critically analyze, and discuss. We draw on Actor-Antecedents-Decisions-Outcomes (AADO) and Theories-Contexts-Methods (TCM) frameworks to synthesize our findings into an integrative framework of in-home service consumption, namely InHoServ. InHoServ provides a comprehensive understanding of the main actors involved in in-home service consumption and delineates their changing role. Finally, we provide a future research agenda highlighting four fruitful areas for researchers (i.e., theorizing in-home service consumption, the changing role of service providers, technology and service consumption at home, and the dark side of in-home consumption). © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: Amidst the plethora of mass communication methods that technology bestowed business with, print advertisements still remain an effective and widely utilized advertising tool, and retain a diachronically venerable position in international marketing practice. Bar and transcending mere academic fascination or curiosity, this research provides insights into the past, an understanding of the present and an outlook into the future. In this vein, through a methodical and comprehensive critical review of extant literature on print advertisements since 1965, this research aims to identify gaps in extant knowledge, to map its trends and divergences, to trace its paradigm shifts and to ultimately develop agendas for truly significant future research. Design/methodology/approach: This spatial-temporal study reviews 256 methodically selected articles, using VantagePoint software, and adopts a novel methodology through natural language processing (NLP), text mining, auto-correlation maps, and bubble maps to conduct and present a robust analysis and explicit findings. Findings: Using also the VOSviewer for density and network visualization, the results identify the predominant literature themes and, conversely, the relatively under-researched areas, and provide a more insightful collective interpretation of extant works, while laying the foundation for future research of greater value and significance to academia and industry. Originality/value: This study transcends the partial and/or limited analyses and perspectives of extant literature to present scholars with the first comprehensive and long term meta-analysis or systematic study of print advertising, with explicit findings of both scholarly and executive worth. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - To help researchers conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis as efficiently and transparently as possible, we designed a tool to accelerate the step of screening titles and abstracts. For many tasks—including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses—the scientific literature needs to be checked systematically. Scholars and practitioners currently screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase of available text. We therefore developed an open source machine learning-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview. We demonstrate by means of simulation studies that active learning can yield far more efficient reviewing than manual reviewing while providing high quality. Furthermore, we describe the options of the free and open source research software and present the results from user experience tests. We invite the community to contribute to open source projects such as our own that provide measurable and reproducible improvements over current practice. © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Systematic reviews are used to collect relevant literature to answer a research question in a way that is clear, thorough, unbiased and reproducible. They are implemented as a standard method in the domain of food safety to obtain a literature overview on the state-of-the-art research related to food safety topics of interest. A disadvantage to systematic reviews, however, is that this process is time-consuming and requires expert domain knowledge. The work reported here aims to reduce the time needed by an expert to screen all possible relevant articles by applying machine learning techniques to classify the articles automatically as either relevant or not relevant. Eight different machine learning algorithms and ensembles of all combinations of these algorithms were tested on two different systematic reviews on food safety (i.e. chemical hazards in cereals and leafy greens). The results showed that the best performance was obtained by an ensemble of naive Bayes and a support vector machine, resulting in an average decrease of 32.8% in the amount of articles the expert has to read and an average decrease in irrelevant articles of 57.8% while keeping 95% of the relevant articles. It was concluded that automatic classification of the literature in a systematic literature review can support experts in their task and save valuable time without compromising the quality of the review. © 2021 The Authors

N2  - The systematic literature review (SLR) process is separated into several steps to increase rigor and reproducibility. The selection of primary studies (i.e., citation screening) is an important step in the SLR process. The citation screening process aims to identify the relevant primary studies fairly and with high rigor using selection criteria. Through the study selection criteria, reviewers determine whether an article should be included or excluded from the SLR. However, the screening process is highly time-consuming and error-prone as the researchers must read each title and possibly hundreds to thousands of abstracts and full-text documents. This study aims to automate the citation screening process using Deep Learning algorithms. With this, it is aimed to reduce the time and costs of the citation screening process and increase the precision and recall of the relevant primary studies. A Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed, which can automatically classify a given set of citations. As the architecture uses the title and abstract as features, our end-to-end pipeline is domain-independent. We have performed six experiments to assess the performance of Multi-Channel CNNs across 20 publicly available systematic literature review datasets. It was shown that for 18 out of 20 review datasets, the proposed method achieved significant workload savings of at least 10%, while in several cases, our model yielded a statistically significantly better performance over two benchmark review datasets. We conclude that Multi-Channel CNNs are effective for the citation screening process in SLRs. Multi-Channel CNNs perform best on large datasets of over 2500 samples with few abstracts missing. © 2021 The Author(s)

N2  - Machine learning and natural language processing algorithms are currently widely used to retrieve relevant documents in a variety of contexts, including literature review and systematic review. Supervised machine learning algorithms perform well in terms of retrieval metrics such as recall and precision, but require the use of a sizeable training dataset, which is typically expensive to develop. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms do not require a training dataset and may perform well in terms of recall, but are typically lower in precision, and do not offer a transparent means for decision-makers to justify selection choices. In this paper, we illustrate the use of a hybrid document classification method based on semi-supervised learning that we refer to as “supervised clustering.” We show that supervised clustering combines the ease of use of unsupervised algorithms with the retrieval efficiency and transparency of supervised algorithms. We demonstrate through simulations the high performance and unbiased predictions of supervised clustering when provided even with only minimal training data. We further propose the use of ensemble learning as a means to maximize retrieval efficiency and to prioritize the review of those documents that are not eliminated by the supervised clustering algorithm. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AU  - Verde, P. E.
PY  - 2019
PD  - 
N2  - The hierarchical metaregression (HMR) approach is a multiparameter Bayesian approach for meta-analysis, which generalizes the standard mixed effects models by explicitly modeling the data collection process in the meta-analysis. The HMR allows to investigate the potential external validity of experimental results as well as to assess the internal validity of the studies included in a systematic review. The HMR automatically identifies studies presenting conflicting evidence and it downweights their influence in the meta-analysis. In addition, the HMR allows to perform cross-evidence synthesis, which combines aggregated results from randomized controlled trials to predict effectiveness in a single-arm observational study with individual participant data (IPD). In this paper, we evaluate the HMR approach using simulated data examples. We present a new real case study in diabetes research, along with a new R package called jarbes (just a rather Bayesian evidence synthesis), which automatizes the complex computations involved in the HMR. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

PD  - 
N2  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has experienced a significant growth over the last few years. This is due to the widespread application of machine learning, particularly deep learning, that has led to the development of highly accurate models that lack explainability and interpretability. A plethora of methods to tackle this problem have been proposed, developed and tested, coupled with several studies attempting to define the concept of explainability and its evaluation. This systematic review contributes to the body of knowledge by clustering all the scientific studies via a hierarchical system that classifies theories and notions related to the concept of explainability and the evaluation approaches for XAI methods. The structure of this hierarchy builds on top of an exhaustive analysis of existing taxonomies and peer-reviewed scientific material. Findings suggest that scholars have identified numerous notions and requirements that an explanation should meet in order to be easily understandable by end-users and to provide actionable information that can inform decision making. They have also suggested various approaches to assess to what degree machine-generated explanations meet these demands. Overall, these approaches can be clustered into human-centred evaluations and evaluations with more objective metrics. However, despite the vast body of knowledge developed around the concept of explainability, there is not a general consensus among scholars on how an explanation should be defined, and how its validity and reliability assessed. Eventually, this review concludes by critically discussing these gaps and limitations, and it defines future research directions with explainability as the starting component of any artificial intelligent system. © 2021 The Authors

N2  - Roadmapping practice and research have evolved together over the past three decades, in response to the changing application context, such as the emergence of cutting-edge technologies and rapid social changes. The widespread adoption and adaptation of (technology) roadmapping has been enabled by its simplicity, flexibility and usefulness, reflected in a surge in the volume of literature on roadmapping. A limited number of literature reviews have been conducted, mostly using qualitative and micro-oriented approaches. This paper, however, deploys a quantitative and macro-oriented approach to provide an objective and comprehensive view of the literature by following DNCT procedures, consisting of citation network and text mining analysis. This paper identifies contributing authors, journals and countries, sets out key research themes, and highlights significant developments in roadmapping practice and theory, with reference to previous studies. Results have proven that roadmapping has become an established research topic. 10 clusters of research streams are detected: General Concept & Scenario; Technology Management Tool; Implementation in National and Industrial Levels; Fundamental Research; Implementation in Organisational Level; Innovation Planning; Strategic Planning Synchronisation; Strategic Foresight; Industrial Emergence; and Design & Visualisation. In addition, an academic landscape of the field is graphically illustrated, and potential avenues for future research are suggested. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - AU Many: Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are biased and difficult : to reproduce due to methodological flaws and poor reporting. There is increasing attention for responsible research practices and implementation of reporting guidelines, but whether these efforts have improved the methodological quality of RCTs (e.g., lower risk of bias) is unknown. We, therefore, mapped risk-of-bias trends over time in RCT publications in relation to journal and author characteristics. Meta-information of 176,620 RCTs published between 1966 and 2018 was extracted. The risk-of-bias probability (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of patients/personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment) was assessed using a risk-of-bias machine learning tool. This tool was simultaneously validated using 63,327 human risk-of-bias assessments obtained from 17,394 RCTs evaluated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). Moreover, RCT registration and CONSORT Statement reporting were assessed using automated searches. Publication characteristics included the number of authors, journal impact factor (JIF), and medical discipline. The annual number of published RCTs substantially increased over 4 decades, accompanied by increases in authors (5.2 to 7.8) and institutions (2.9 to 4.8). The risk of bias remained present in most RCTs but decreased over time for allocation concealment (63% to 51%), random sequence generation (57% to 36%), and blinding of outcome assessment (58% to 52%). Trial registration (37% to 47%) and the use of the CONSORT Statement (1% to 20%) also rapidly increased. In journals with a higher impact factor (>10), the risk of bias was consistently lower with higher levels of RCT registration and the use of the CONSORT Statement. Automated risk-of-bias predictions had accuracies above 70% for allocation concealment (70.7%), random sequence generation (72.1%), and blinding of patients/personnel (79.8%), but not for blinding of outcome assessment (62.7%). In conclusion, the likelihood of bias in RCTs has generally decreased over the last decades. This optimistic trend may be driven by increased knowledge augmented by mandatory trial registration and more stringent reporting guidelines and journal requirements. Nevertheless, relatively high probabilities of bias remain, particularly in journals with lower impact factors. This emphasizes that further improvement of RCT registration, conduct, and reporting is still urgently needed. Copyright: © 2021 Vinkers et al.

N2  - Objectives: Risk-of-bias assessment is a central component of systematic reviews, but little conclusive empirical evidence exists on the validity of such assessments. In the context of such uncertainty, we present pragmatic recommendations that promote transparency and reproducibility in processes, address methodological advances in the risk-of-bias assessment, and can be applied consistently across review topics. Study Design and Setting: Epidemiological study design principles; available empirical evidence, risk-of-bias tools, and guidance; and workgroup consensus. Results: We developed recommendations for assessing the risk of bias of studies of health-care interventions specific to framing the focus and scope of risk-of-bias assessment; selecting the risk-of-bias categories; choosing assessment instruments; and conducting, analyzing, and presenting results of risk-of-bias assessments. Key recommendations include transparency and reproducibility of judgments, separating risk of bias from other constructs such as applicability and precision, and evaluating the risk of bias per outcome. We recommend against certain past practices, such as focusing on reporting quality, relying solely on study design or numerical quality scores, and automatically downgrading for industry sponsorship. Conclusion: Risk-of-bias assessment remains a challenging but essential step in systematic reviews. We presented standards to promote transparency of judgments. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform traditional research practices in many areas. In this context, literature reviews stand out because they operate on large and rapidly growing volumes of documents, that is, partially structured (meta)data, and pervade almost every type of paper published in information systems research or related social science disciplines. To familiarize researchers with some of the recent trends in this area, we outline how AI can expedite individual steps of the literature review process. Considering that the use of AI in this context is in an early stage of development, we propose a comprehensive research agenda for AI-based literature reviews (AILRs) in our field. With this agenda, we would like to encourage design science research and a broader constructive discourse on shaping the future of AILRs in research. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2021.

N2  - A scientific review is a type of article that summarizes the current state of a specific field, which is crucial for promoting the advancement of our science community. Authors need to read hundreds of research articles to prepare the data and insights for a comprehensive review, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this work, we present an algorithm that can automatically extract keywords from the meta-information of each article and generate the basic data for review articles. Two different fields-communication engineering, and lab on a chip technology-were analyzed as examples. We first built an article library by downloading all the articles from the target journal using a python-based crawler. Second, the rapid automatic keyword extraction algorithm was implemented on the title and abstract of each article. Finally, we classified all extracted keywords into class by calculating the Levenshtein distance between each of them. The results demonstrated its capability of not only finding out how communication engineering and lab on a chip were evolved in the past decades but also summarizing the analytical outcomes after data mining of the extracted keywords. Our algorithm is more than a useful tool for researchers during the preparation of a review article, it can also be applied to quantitatively analyze the past, present and help authors predict the future trend of a specific research field. © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Purpose: This study aims to demonstrate the suitability of text-mining toolset for the discovery of trends in quality management (QM) literature in 2000-2019. The hypothesis was formulated that as the field of study is mature, the most important trends are related to deepening and broadening of the knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: A novel approach to trend discovery was proposed. The computer-aided analysis of full-texts of papers led to increased reliability and level of detail of the achieved results and helped significantly reduce researchers’ bias. Overall, 4,833 papers from 8 journal dedicated to QM were analysed. Findings: Trends discovery led to the identification of 45 trends: 17 long-lasting trends, 4 declining trends, 11 emerging trends and 13 ephemeris trends. They were compared to the results of earlier studies. New trends and potential gaps were discussed. Practical implications: The results highlight the trends that gain or lose popularity, thus they can be used to focus studies, as well as find new subjects, which are not so popular yet. The knowledge about emerging trends is also important for those quality managers who strive for improvement of their efficiency. Originality/value: The research was designed to bypass the limitations of previous studies. The use of text mining methods and analysis of full texts of papers delivered more detailed and reliable data. Resignation from predefinition of classification criteria significantly reduced researchers’ bias and allowed the discovery of new trends, not identified in previous studies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Purpose: The objectives of the study were to demonstrate the suitability of methodology based on a text mining toolset for detecting trends in scientific papers and to find trends that were present in the field of project management during the research time span (2000–2019). Design/methodology/approach: An approach based on text mining tools supported by expert analysis was adopted due to an extensive number of publications in the field of project management. The novelty of the approach lies in the proposed method of trends discovery instead of the commonly used trends predefinition. The use of computer support allowed the full texts of papers, and not only abstracts, to be analysed, which significantly increased the reliability of the achieved results. Overall, 3,544 papers from seven journals were analysed. Findings: As a result, 43 trends were discovered including seven long-lasting, four declining, 17 emerging and 15 ephemeris trends. Trends were analysed in comparison with the results of previous studies and project management frameworks. New trends and potential gaps were discussed. Originality/value: The results highlight the topics of research that gain popularity among researchers, and which are related to the current problems that arise in project management. Therefore, the results can help focus studies on the most important areas, as well as find new ones which are not so popular yet. The knowledge of current trends is also important for those project managers who seek to improve the efficiency of their work. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - The explosive growth of green building (GB) research over the past few decades has posed great challenges for researchers to effectively grasp the holistic GB research status. This paper presents a text mining based method to identify the key research topics and trends from the existing abundant GB research publications. In total, 2421 articles are retrieved from the Web of Science core database. Subsequently, three mutually integrated text mining techniques, including the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) modeling, Word2vec, and community network analysis, are employed for knowledge discovery. Results show that the number of GB research topics increased from 1990 to 2020, while design optimization and energy efficient measures have always been the research hotspots. The identified research themes are further categorized into nine general research areas, including GB design, energy saving, GB rating system, life cycle evaluation, incentive and hindrances, post-occupancy evaluation, GB technologies, GB market, and management aspects of GB. Based on the revealed emerging research themes in recent ten years, three research directions are further proposed, such as green building market, employment of digital technologies, and safety risks in GB projects. This research provides an applicable quantitative method to efficiently identify the research topics from the extensive research publications and establishes a comprehensive knowledge framework of the GB research status at different stages. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background: Although biomedical publications and literature are growing rapidly, there still lacks structured knowledge that can be easily processed by computer programs. In order to extract such knowledge from plain text and transform them into structural form, the relation extraction problem becomes an important issue. Datasets play a critical role in the development of relation extraction methods. However, existing relation extraction datasets in biomedical domain are mainly human-annotated, whose scales are usually limited due to their labor-intensive and time-consuming nature. Results: We construct BioRel, a large-scale dataset for biomedical relation extraction problem, by using Unified Medical Language System as knowledge base and Medline as corpus. We first identify mentions of entities in sentences of Medline and link them to Unified Medical Language System with Metamap. Then, we assign each sentence a relation label by using distant supervision. Finally, we adapt the state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical machine learning methods as baseline models and conduct comprehensive experiments on the BioRel dataset. Conclusions: Based on the extensive experimental results, we have shown that BioRel is a suitable large-scale datasets for biomedical relation extraction, which provides both reasonable baseline performance and many remaining challenges for both deep learning and statistical methods. © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Meta-analysis is a widely used tool in which weighted information from multiple similar studies is aggregated to increase statistical power. However, the exponential growth of publications in key areas of medical science has rendered manual identification of relevant studies increasingly time-consuming. The aim of this work was to develop a machine learning technique capable of robust automatic study selection for meta-analysis. We have validated this approach with an up-to-date meta-analysis to investigate the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods: The PubMed online database was searched from 1960 to September 2017 where 4,177 publications that mentioned both DM and AF were identified. Relevant studies were selected as follows. First, publications were clustered based on common text features using an unsupervised K-means algorithm. Clusters that best matched the selected set of potentially relevant studies (a "training" set of 139 articles) were then identified by using maximum entropy classification. The 139 articles selected automatically on this basis were screened manually to identify potentially relevant studies. To determine the validity of the automated process, a parallel set of studies was also assembled by manually screening all initially searched publications. Finally, detailed manual selection was performed on the full texts of the studies in both sets using standard criteria. Quality assessment, meta-regression random-effects models, sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment were then conducted. Results: Machine learning-assisted screening identified the same 29 studies for meta-analysis as those identified by using manual screening alone. Machine learning enabled more robust and efficient study selection, reducing the number of studies needed for manual screening from 4,177 to 556 articles. A pooled analysis using the most conservative estimates indicated that patients with DM had ~49% greater risk of developing AF compared with individuals without DM. After adjusting for three additional risk factors i.e., hypertension, obesity and heart disease, the relative risk was 23%. Using multivariate adjusted models, the risk for developing AF in patients with DM was similar for all DM subtypes. Women with DM were 24% more likely to develop AF than men with DM. The risk for new-onset AF in patients with DM has also increased over the years. Conclusions: We have developed a novel machine learning method to identify publications suitable for inclusion in meta-analysis. This approach has the capacity to provide for a more efficient and more objective study selection process for future such studies. We have used it to demonstrate that DM is a strong, independent risk factor for AF, particularly for women. © 2018 Xiong, Liu, Tse, Gong, Gladding, Smaill, Stiles, Gillis and Zhao.

N2  - Rough set (RS) is a mathematical framework used to deal with incomplete and uncertain information. It has been widely used in decision analysis, data mining, artificial intelligence, economic management and many other fields. Up to now, there have been tens of thousands of research papers on this topic, and the area has made a rapid growth. In light of these factors, a comprehensive and systematic review of this area becomes essential. The purpose of this study is to present a coherent overview of the theory and applications of the RS, reveal its current research focal points, and identify future development trends. We conduct a thorough bibliometric review and perform co-occurrence and co-citation analysis. First, the fundamental characteristics, productive authors, preferred journals and leading countries in the field of RS are identified. Second, the co-citation and citation burst detection methods are used to explore research hotspot and trends. In light of the undertaken methodology, this study can offer tangible value to scholars in understanding the content structure and development process of the RS field. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

PD  - 
N2  - Background. Bladder cancer is amongst the top 10 most common neoplasms worldwide. It is responsible for over 150,000 deaths per annum. It is of great importance to study its clinical diagnosis and management. As a literature synthesis technique, bibliometrics analysis helps us to take our knowledge of bladder cancer diagnosis research, topics, and trends a step further. It is critical to elucidate the literature landscape and its pertinent impact on this field, in order to have a better understanding and improved management of bladder cancer. Materials and Methods. Search terms related to bladder cancer diagnosis were used to retrieval publications which met the predefined criteria in the Scopus database developed by Elsevier. Included articles were further evaluated by year of publication, country, language, institution, article type, source journal, coauthorship networks, and text mining of titles. The R software, as well as the tm, ggplot2 packages, and the VOSviewer (version 1.6.15) were used as software tools. Results. A comprehensive literature search in the Scopus database returned a total of 824 publication items. Among them, 601 (72.94%) were published as journal articles, and 117 (14.20%) were published as reviews. The number of annual publications in this field has been increasing in recent years. English represents the language used in the majority of the articles (634, 77.13%). The highest number of citations received for a single article is as high as 628 times. We also clustered and visualized a network of 701 authors with no less than 3 publications. The term cloud and hierarchical clustering dendrogram which revealed with text mining were used to discover the hot research topics in this field. We also statistically analyzed evolution of the major journal impact indices, including Impact Factor, EigenFactor Score, and CiteScore of 11 journals with a period of 9 years. Conclusion. Through bibliometrics analysis, we found hot topics and related research focuses and trends in bladder cancer diagnosis. This bibliometrics analysis has identified influential articles in the field and provides a useful guide to researchers as to what type of article constitutes a highly citable publication in this subject. In addition, a coauthorship network helps researchers find out which team may be a potential partner and where their studies focus on. © 2021 Yuan Zhang et al.

N2  - Narrative literature reviews can be subjective, laborious, and difficult to replicate. To minimize human inputs and increase transparency, we generated a thematic scheme of leadership topics, and used software tools to code and organize 2115 leadership articles authored by 3190 authors and published in 10 academic journals from 1990 to 2017. We visually present the empirically-grounded taxonomies of 56 popular research topics and the collaboration network of 160 productive leadership scholars. Shifts of popular topics and active scholars across four 7-year intervals are shown, with our reflections on the rises and declines of charismatic and authentic leadership theories. We discuss how artificial intelligence can enhance the scientific value of literature reviews. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Various instruments for patient screening and diagnosis have been developed for and applied in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objective: This study comprehensively investigates the prevalence and temporal trends of the most widely used instruments in PTSD-related studies. Methods: A total of 1345 files of registered clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov and 9422 abstracts from the PubMed database from 2005 to 2020 were downloaded for this study. The instruments applied in clinical trials were manually annotated, and instruments in abstracts were recognized using exact string matching. The prevalence score of an instrument in a certain period was calculated as the number of studies divided by the number of instances of the instrument. By calculating the yearly prevalence index of each instrument, we conducted a trends analysis and compared the trends in index change between instruments. Results: A total of 4178 instrument synonyms were annotated, which were mapped to 1423 unique instruments. In the 16 years from 2005 to 2020, only 10 instruments were used more than once per year; the 4 most used instruments were the PTSD Checklist, the Clinician-Administered PTSD Disorder Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory. There were 18 instruments whose yearly prevalence index score exceeded 0.1 at least once during the 16 years. The changes in trends and time points of partial instruments in clinical trials and PubMed abstracts were highly consistent. The average time duration of a PTSD-related trial was 1495.5 days or approximately 4 years from submission to ClinicalTrial.gov to publication in a journal. Conclusions: The application of widely accepted and appropriate instruments can help improve the reliability of research results in PTSD-related clinical studies. With extensive text data obtained from real clinical trials and published articles, we investigated and compared the usage of instruments in the PTSD research community. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc..

N2  - Pasture-based and small-scale livestock farming systems are the main source of livelihood in the mountain primary sector, ensuring socioeconomic sustainability and biodiversity in rural communities throughout Europe and beyond. Mountain livestock farming (MLF) has attracted substantial research efforts from a wide variety of scientific communities worldwide. In this study, the use of text mining and topic modelling analysis drew a detailed picture of the main research topics dealing with MLF and their trends over the last four decades. The final data corpus used for the analysis counted 2 679 documents, of which 92% were peer-reviewed scientific publications. The number of scientific outputs in MLF doubled every 10 years since 1980. Text mining found that milk, goat and sheep were the terms with the highest weighed frequency in the data corpus. Ten meaningful topics were identified by topic analysis: T1-Livestock management and vegetation dynamics; T2-Animal health and epidemiology; T3-Methodological studies on cattle; T4-Production system and sustainability; T5-Methodological studies; T6-Wildlife and conservation studies; T7-Reproduction and performance; T8-Dairy/meat production and quality; T9-Land use and its change and T10-Genetic/genomic studies. A hierarchical clustering analysis was performed to explore the interrelationships among topics, and three main clusters were identified: the first focused on sustainability, conservation and socioeconomic aspects (T4; T6 and T9), the second was related to food production and quality (T7 and T8) and the last one considered methodological studies on mountain flora and fauna (T1; T2; T3; T5 and T10). The 10 topics identified represent a useful and a starting source of information for further and more detailed analysis (e.g. systematic review) of specific research or geographical areas. A truly holistic and interdisciplinary research approach is needed to identify drivers of change and to understand current and future challenges faced by livestock farming in mountain areas. © 2020 The Authors

TI  - Trends and Challenges Regarding Cyber Risk Mitigation by CISOs—A Systematic Literature and Experts’ Opinion Review Based on Text Analytics
AU  - Zwilling, M.
PY  - 2022
PD  - 
N2  - Background: Cyber security has turned out to be one of the main challenges of recent years. As the variety of system and application vulnerabilities has increased dramatically in recent years, cyber attackers have managed to penetrate the networks and infrastructures of larger numbers of companies, thus increasing the latter’s exposure to cyber threats. To mitigate this exposure, it is crucial for CISOs to have sufficient training and skills to help them identify how well security controls are managed and whether these controls offer the company sufficient protection against cyber threats, as expected. However, recent literature shows a lack of clarity regarding the manner in which the CISOs’ role and the companies’ investment in their skills should change in view of these developments. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the CISOs’ level of cyber security-related preparation to mitigate cyber threats (and specifically, the companies’ attitudes toward investing in such preparation) and the recent evolution of cyber threats. Methods: The study data are based on the following public resources: (1) recent scientific literature; (2) cyber threat-related opinion news articles; and (3) OWASP’s reported list of vulnerabilities. Data analysis was performed using various text mining methods and tools. Results: The study’s findings show that although the implementation of cyber defense tools has gained more serious attention in recent years, CISOs still lack sufficient support from management and sufficient knowledge and skills to mitigate current and new cyber threats. Conclusions: The research outcomes may allow practitioners to examine whether the companies’ level of cyber security controls matches the CISOs’ skills, and whether a comprehensive security education program is required. The present article discusses these findings and their implications. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Construction, the last major analog and craft manufacturing industry, is showing early signs of industrialization through the emergence of new robotic and automated systems that can perform construction tasks in situ. While much is understood about the technical and economic challenges to be overcome for widespread adoption of robotics, less is known about the human barriers to adoption, and much less is summarized. Considering the amount of human cooperation required by existing robotic applications, a comprehensive review of barriers that are cognitive or perceptual in nature using a systematic literature assessment methodology is warranted. However, such a review is not straightforward to design. While matters of cognition and perception as pertinent to construction and automation may be queried directly from the literature, there is no certainty that a review based on directly querying abstract phenomena (i.e., perception) could be comprehensive. Thus, systematically reviewing this topic calls for a robust methodology for the design of database queries. In this paper, we perform text analysis with the quanteda package for R in order to (1) understand the language composition of an initial review corpus, and (2) with that understanding design further queries to capture additional articles otherwise not possible through standard query design. Findings indicate that performing text analysis on a systematic review design can produce valuable insight into a review corpus and inform queries that capture additional unique literature relevant to the review. © 2022 ASCE.

This was addressed by achieving three things: (a) identifying the key topics addressed in existing big data research in health care, (b) measuring associations between topics in existing studies, and (c) constructing time series profiles for the various topics addressed in big data and healthcare research. Going beyond the common review methodologies in this domain, we introduce a comprehensive literature survey methodology, based on systems theory and PRISMA framework. Using the survey methodology, 2,941 research articles that were published between 2012 and 2019 were analyzed to both synthesize and develop the findings presented in this study. Based on this study’s findings, a comprehensive overview of researchers’ interest toward different methodologies, technologies and subject areas is provided, which include the identification of substantial gaps in research for further development. © 2021 International Association for Computer Information Systems.

PY  - 2022
PD  - 
N2  - In the process of Systematic Literature Review, citation screening is estimated to be one of the most time-consuming steps. Multiple approaches to automate it using various machine learning techniques have been proposed. The first research papers that apply deep neural networks to this problem were published in the last two years. In this work, we conduct a replicability study of the first two deep learning papers for citation screening [8, 16] and evaluate their performance on 23 publicly available datasets. While we succeeded in replicating the results of one of the papers, we were unable to replicate the results of the other. We summarise the challenges involved in the replication, including difficulties in obtaining the datasets to match the experimental setup of the original papers and problems with executing the original source code. Motivated by this experience, we subsequently present a simpler model based on averaging word embeddings that outperforms one of the models on 18 out of 23 datasets and is, on average, 72 times faster than the second replicated approach. Finally, we measure the training time and the invariance of the models when exposed to a variety of input features and random initialisations, demonstrating differences in the robustness of these approaches. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - This study offers a literature review and bibliometric analysis aiming to enhance our understanding of the actual contribution of resilience approaches to spatial and territorial development and planning studies. Using citation link-based clustering and statistical text-mining techniques (in terms of prevalence of topics, over time, extraction of relevant terms, keywords frequencies), our study maps scientific domains that include the spatial dimension of resilience thinking. It offers a systematic assessment of modern approaches by connecting profoundly theoretical views to more instrumental and policy-oriented approaches. Firstly, the theoretical background of spatial resilience used in numerous studies in various fields is analysed from the viewpoint of the type of embedded resilience (engineering, ecological, social-ecological, economic, social etc.). Secondly, we review and discuss the significance of three main and consistent research directions in terms of different scales and political/institutional contexts that matter from the viewpoint of spatial and territorial planning. Our findings show that spatial resilience debates are far from being settled, as according to many scientists, resilience measurements are often based on technical-reductionist frameworks that cannot comprehensively reflect the complex systems and issues they address. Our conclusions highlight the necessity of a harmonized framework and integrated perspective on resilience in sustainable territorial planning and development, in both theoretical and empirical contexts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

PD  - 
N2  - Big data analytics utilizes different techniques to transform large volumes of big datasets. The analytics techniques utilize various computational methods such as Machine Learning (ML) for converting raw data into valuable insights. The ML assists individuals in performing work activities intelligently, which empowers decision-makers. Since academics and industry practitioners have growing interests in ML, various existing review studies have explored different applications of ML for enhancing knowledge about specific problem domains. However, in most of the cases existing studies suffer from the limitations of employing a holistic, automated approach. While several researchers developed various techniques to automate the systematic literature review process, they also seemed to lack transparency and guidance for future researchers. This research aims to promote the utilization of intelligent literature reviews for researchers by introducing a step-by-step automated framework. We offer an intelligent literature review to obtain in-depth analytical insight of ML applications in the clinical domain to (a) develop the intelligent literature framework using traditional literature and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, (b) analyze research documents using traditional systematic literature review revealing ML applications, and (c) identify topics from documents using LDA topic modeling. We used a PRISMA framework for the review to harness samples sourced from four major databases (e.g., IEEE, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) published between 2016 and 2021 (September). The framework comprises two stages—(a) traditional systematic literature review consisting of three stages (planning, conducting, and reporting) and (b) LDA topic modeling that consists of three steps (pre-processing, topic modeling, and post-processing). The intelligent literature review framework transparently and reliably reviewed 305 sample documents. © 2022, The Author(s).

N2  - The so-called Fourth Paradigm has witnessed a boom during the past two decades, with large volumes of observational data becoming available to scientists and engineers. Big data is characterized by the rule of the five Vs: Volume, Variety, Value, Velocity and Veracity. The concept of big data naturally matches well with the features of geoengineering and geoscience. Large-scale, comprehensive, multidirectional and multifield geotechnical data analysis is becoming a trend. On the other hand, Machine learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Optimization Algorithm (OA) provide the ability to learn from data and deliver in-depth insight into geotechnical problems. Researchers use different ML, DL and OA models to solve various problems associated with geoengineering and geoscience. Consequently, there is a need to extend its research with big data research through integrating the use of ML, DL and OA techniques. This work focuses on a systematic review on the state-of-the-art application of ML, DL and OA algorithms in geoengineering and geoscience. Various ML, DL, and OA approaches are firstly concisely introduced, concerning mainly the supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning and optimization algorithms. Then their representative applications in the geoengineering and geoscience are summarized via VOSviewer demonstration. The authors also provided their own thoughts learnt from these applications as well as work ongoing and future recommendations. This review paper aims to make a comprehensive summary and provide fundamental guidelines for researchers and engineers in the discipline of geoengineering and geoscience or similar research areas on how to integrate and apply ML, DL and OA methods. © 2022 International Association for Gondwana Research

As the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics emerge in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, there is an immediate need to study trust in such systems. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of the literature published in the last two decades on (1) trust in AI and AI-powered robotics and (2) AI and robotics applications in the AEC industry. Through a thorough analysis, common trust dimensions are identified and the connections to the existing AEC applications are determined and discussed. Furthermore, major future directions on trustworthy AI and robotics in AEC research and practice are outlined. Findings indicate that although AEC researchers and industry professionals increasingly study and deploy AI and robotics, there is a lack of systematic research that studies key trust dimensions such as explainability, reliability, robustness, performance, and safety in the AEC context © 2022 The Authors

N2  - Informatization and automatization are considered mainstream trends in the future architecture-engineering-construction/facility management (AEC/FM) industry. Building information modeling (BIM) is an effective technology to digitize building information, whereas artificial intelligence (AI) techniques facilitate automation. It could be contributive to focus on how to integrate BIM with AI techniques and apply them in actual projects. However, a comprehensive review of integrated applications is still lacking. This study reviews BIM-AI integrations in the AEC/FM industry by systematic-bibliometric analysis, and 183 eligible literature items are adopted. Bibliometric analysis reveals time series, journals, keywords co-occurrence, and co-authorship of eligible literature. Findings are summarized from perspectives of techniques and applications. Three typical integrated modes are determined based on the findings. Ultimately, current challenges and future directions of the development of BIM-AI integrations are proposed. This review contributes to systematically exploring applications of BIM-AI integrations in AEC/FM industry and delivers valuable development directions for BIM and AI. © 2021

N2  - Background: Systematic reviews (SRs) are central to evaluating therapies but have high costs in terms of both time and money. Many software tools exist to assist with SRs, but most tools do not support the full process, and transparency and replicability of SR depend on performing and presenting evidence according to established best practices. Objective: This study aims to provide a basis for comparing and selecting between web-based software tools that support SR, by conducting a feature-by-feature comparison of SR tools. Methods: We searched for SR tools by reviewing any such tool listed in the SR Toolbox, previous reviews of SR tools, and qualitative Google searching. We included all SR tools that were currently functional and required no coding, and excluded reference managers, desktop applications, and statistical software. The list of features to assess was populated by combining all features assessed in 4 previous reviews of SR tools; we also added 5 features (manual addition, screening automation, dual extraction, living review, and public outputs) that were independently noted as best practices or enhancements of transparency and replicability. Then, 2 reviewers assigned binary present or absent assessments to all SR tools with respect to all features, and a third reviewer adjudicated all disagreements. Results: Of the 53 SR tools found, 55% (29/53) were excluded, leaving 45% (24/53) for assessment. In total, 30 features were assessed across 6 classes, and the interobserver agreement was 86.46%. DistillerSR (Evidence Partners; 26/30, 87%), Nested Knowledge (Nested Knowledge; 25/30, 83%), and EPPI-Reviewer Web (EPPI-Centre; 24/30, 80%) support the most features followed by Giotto Compliance (Giotto Compliance; 23/30, 77%), LitStream (ICF), and SRDB.PRO (VTS Software). Fewer than half of all the features assessed are supported by 7 tools: RobotAnalyst (National Centre for Text Mining), SRDR (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), SyRF (Systematic Review Facility), Data Abstraction Assistant (Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health), SR Accelerator (Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare), RobotReviewer (RobotReviewer), and COVID-NMA (COVID-NMA). Notably, of the 24 tools, only 10 (42%) support direct search, only 7 (29%) offer dual extraction, and only 13 (54%) offer living/updatable reviews. Conclusions: DistillerSR, Nested Knowledge, and EPPI-Reviewer Web each offer a high density of SR-focused web-based tools. By transparent comparison and discussion regarding SR tool functionality, the medical community can both choose among existing software offerings and note the areas of growth needed, most notably in the support of living reviews. © Kathryn Cowie, Asad Rahmatullah, Nicole Hardy, Karl Holub, Kevin Kallmes.

N2  - This exploratory study utilises quantitative analysis to deliver a systematic literature review of published journal papers from 1993 to 2020 with the aim to identify research trends and present a comprehensive overview of research focus conducted in the sustainable packaging domain within the scope of supply chain management. This research is conducted with the data mining software, NetMiner 4, utilising the three analytical tools of statistical analysis, keyword network analysis, and topic analysis. The research also utilises the qualitative method of in-depth interviews in order to investigate current trends and perspectives on the future of sustainable packaging and to validate the analysis results. The research findings reveal that research in the field of ‘sustainable packaging in supply chain management’ field has been extremely limited, and this study acts to address this research gap. The results confirm that the vast majority of research focus has been in the fields of engineering and science. Research on the topic has gained momentum and has significantly increased since 2013 with research trends becoming increasingly diversified and gradually aligned with the concept of circular economy, while the topic of operational management has been highlighted as an area requiring additional attention. The keyword frequency analysis reveals the following highest occurring keywords in TF: life cycle; environmental impact; consumer; transportation; and production. The highest occurring keywords in TF-IDF: production; transportation; consumer; food; and environmental impact. Topic modelling revealed the following six topics: consumer behaviour; environmental pollution; circular economy; waste management; resource conservation; and operational management. This study contributes to understanding past, present, and future research agendas, and can be utilised as foundation for research development, as it provides insight to current research status and trends provided by the keyword network analysis highlighting research focus and trends in ‘sustainable packaging in supply chain management’. © 2022 by the authors.

PD  - 
N2  - In recent years, the use of asynchronous discussion forums in online learning has increased rapidly. In earlier studies, content analysis is the most-used research method in exploring the discussion transcripts. However, conventional content analysis is a time-consuming task and requires experienced coders. There is a need for an automated approach to analyse the online discussion transcripts to help instructors optimise the learners' learning experiences. This article presents a systematic literature review of the automated content analysis approach in online discussion transcripts. Fifty-four relevant peer-reviewed conference and journal papers were found between January 2016 and October 2021, using the PRISMA and snowball methods. Eight measurement dimensions were studied from online learning transcripts: cognitive, social, relevance/importance, summary, pattern, behaviour, topic, and learning resources. Six theoretical frameworks were used in the selected studies, namely the Community of Inquiry, Stump's Post Classification, Arguello's Speech Acts, ICAP, Wise's Speaking Behaviour, and Bloom's Taxonomy. All selected studies are experimental, with 93% using machine learning to analyse discussion transcripts. English is the most-used language dataset, used in 78% of studies. These studies reported promising results in accuracy and precision. However, this research area still has room for improvement, especially in the reliability and generalisability of cross-domain context. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Smart lighting has become a universal smart product solution, with global revenues of up to US $5.9 billion by 2021. Six main factors drive the technology: light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, sensors, control, analytics, and intelligence. The Internet of things (IoT) concept with the end device, platform, and application layer plays an essential role in optimizing the advantages of LED lighting in the emergence of smart lighting. The ultimate aim of smart lighting research is to introduce low energy efficiency and high user comfort, where the latter is still in the infancy stage. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) from a bird's eye view covering full-length research topics on smart lighting, including issues, implementation targets, technological solutions, and prospects. In addition to that, this paper also provides a detailed and extensive overview of emerging machine learning techniques as a key solution to overcome complex problems in smart lighting. A comprehensive review of improving user comfort is also presented, such as the methodology and taxonomy of activity recognition as a promising solution and user comfort metrics, including light utilization ratio, unmet comfort ratio, light to comfort ratio, power reduction rate, flickering perception, Kruithof's comfort curve, correlated color temperature, and relative mean square error. Finally, we discuss in-depth open issues and future challenges in increasing user comfort in smart lighting using activity recognition. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Background/Aims: Informed clinical guidance and health policy relies on clinicians, policymakers, and guideline developers finding comprehensive clinical evidence and linking registrations and publications of the same clinical trial. To support the finding and linking of trial evidence, the World Health Organization, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials ask researchers to provide the trial registration number in their publication and a reference to the publication in the registration. This practice costs researchers minimal effort and makes evidence synthesis more thorough and efficient. Nevertheless, trial evidence appears inadequately linked, and the extent of trial links in Germany remains unquantified. This cross-sectional study aims to evaluate links between registrations and publications across clinical trials conducted by German university medical centers and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov or the German Clinical Trials Registry. Secondary aims are to develop an automated pipeline that can be applied to other cohorts of trial registrations and publications, and to provide stakeholders, from trialists to registries, with guidance to improve trial links. Methods: We used automated strategies to download and extract data from trial registries, PubMed, and results publications for a cohort of registered, published trials conducted across German university medical centers and completed between 2009 and 2017. We implemented regular expressions to detect and classify publication identifiers in registrations, and trial registration numbers in publication metadata, abstracts, and full-texts. Results: In breach of long-standing guidelines, 75% (1,418) of trials failed to reference trial registration numbers in both the abstract and full-text of the journal article in which the results were published. Furthermore, 50% (946) of trial registrations did not contain links to their results publications. Seventeen percent (327) of trials had no links, so that associating registration and publication required manual searching and screening. Overall, trials in ClinicalTrials.gov were better linked than those in the German Clinical Trials Registry; PubMed and registry infrastructures appear to drive this difference. Trial registration numbers were more likely to be transferred to PubMed metadata from abstracts for ClinicalTrials.gov trials than for German Clinical Trials Registry trials. Most (78%, 662/849) ClinicalTrials.gov registrations with a publication link were automatically indexed from PubMed metadata, which is not possible in the German Clinical Trials Registry. Conclusions: German university medical centers have not comprehensively linked trial registrations and publications, despite established recommendations. This shortcoming threatens the quality of evidence synthesis and medical practice, and burdens researchers with manually searching and linking trial data. Researchers could easily improve this by copy-and-pasting references between their trial registrations and publications. Other stakeholders could build on this practice, for example, PubMed could capture additional trial registration numbers using automated strategies (like those developed in this study), and the German Clinical Trials Registry could automatically index publications from PubMed. © The Author(s) 2022.

Understanding how these models behave, and what their output is based on, is a challenge for developers let alone non-technical end users. Design/methodology/approach: The authors investigate how AI systems and their decisions ought to be explained for end users through a systematic literature review. Findings: The authors’ synthesis of the literature suggests that AI system communication for end users has five high-level goals: (1) understandability, (2) trustworthiness, (3) transparency, (4) controllability and (5) fairness. The authors identified several design recommendations, such as offering personalized and on-demand explanations and focusing on the explainability of key functionalities instead of aiming to explain the whole system. There exists multiple trade-offs in AI system explanations, and there is no single best solution that fits all cases. Research limitations/implications: Based on the synthesis, the authors provide a design framework for explaining AI systems to end users. The study contributes to the work on AI governance by suggesting guidelines on how to make AI systems more understandable, fair, trustworthy, controllable and transparent.

N2  - The exact nature, harmful effects and aetiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have caused widespread confusion. Artificial intelligence (AI) science helps solve challenging diagnostic problems in the medical field through extensive experiments. Disease severity is closely related to triage decisions and prioritisation contexts in medicine because both have been widely used to diagnose various diseases via AI, machine learning and automated decision-making techniques. Recently, taking advantage of high-performance AI algorithms has achieved accessible success in diagnosing and predicting risks from clinical and biological data. In contrast, less progress has been made with ASD because of obscure reasons. According to academic literature, ASD diagnosis works from a specific perspective, and much of the confusion arises from the fact that how AI techniques are currently integrated with the diagnosis of ASD concerning the triage and priority strategies and gene contributions. To this end, this study sought to describe a systematic review of the literature to assess the respective AI methods using the available datasets, highlight the tools and strategies used for diagnosing ASD and investigate how AI trends contribute in distinguishing triage and priority for ASD and gene contributions. Accordingly, this study checked the Science Direct, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Web of Science (WoS), PubMed, and Scopus databases. A set of 363 articles from 2017 to 2022 is collected to reveal a clear picture and a better understanding of all the academic literature through a final set of 18 articles. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and classified into three categories. The first category includes ‘Triage patients based on diagnosis methods’ which accounts for 16.66% (n = 3/18). The second category includes ‘Prioritisation for Risky Genes’ which accounts for 66.6% (n = 12/18) and is classified into two subcategories: ‘Mutations observation based’, ‘Biomarkers and toxic chemical observations’. The third category includes ‘E-triage using telehealth’ which accounts for 16.66% (n = 3/18). This multidisciplinary systematic review revealed the taxonomy, motivations, recommendations and challenges of ASD research that need synergistic attention. Thus, this systematic review performs a comprehensive science mapping analysis and discusses the open issues that help perform and improve the recommended solution of ASD research direction. In addition, this study critically reviews the literature and attempts to address the current research gaps in knowledge and highlights weaknesses that require further research. Finally, a new developed methodology has been suggested as future work for triaging and prioritising ASD patients according to their severity levels by using decision-making techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

PD  - 
N2  - With cloud computing, organizations must comply with applicable laws, policies, and best practices. Companies typically rely on cloud service providers to implement and adopt regulations. This consulting phase is often time‐consuming, costly, and not transparent. Organizations must trust the third party’s implementation and associated documentation processes. To resolve this dilemma, we present a blockchain‐based reference architecture for the automated, transparent, and notarized attestation of such compliance adaptations. Before proposing a solution, our approach is to understand the underlying research context. We conduct a machine‐learning‐supported systematic literature review to create a knowledge base. A reference architecture, including a prototype for configuring intrusion‐detection systems, is developed using design science research. A mixed‐methods‐based approach is used for the evaluation of the proposed architecture. A quantitative survey is then used to show that the user experience of the developed prototype can be rated as positive, with an average value of 0.7. Finally, two focus group discussions are used to analyze the presented prototype qualitatively. As a result, we demonstrate how to actively support secure and trustworthy communication between a cloud service provider and an organization applying blockchain configurations. © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Healthcare 4.0 has changed dramatically over the last century. It is evolving daily, with physicians and researchers alike developing new tools and strategies. This study analyzes the impact of Industry 4.0 on healthcare (IHC) systems. Therefore, using PRISMA 2015, a systematic literature review was undertaken utilizing articles retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science. A bibliometric and qualitative assessment of 346 and 47 articles was performed. An IHC framework was developed considering the following components: scheduling problems, security issues, COVID-19, digital supply chain, blockchain technology, and artificial intelligence. The study found that during COVID-19, healthcare, and Industry4.0 fused and evolved together, addressing issues including data security, resource allocation, and data transparency. IHC enables a variety of technologies, including the internet of things (IoT), blockchain, big data, cloud computing, machine learning, and information and communication technologies (ICT), to track patient records and contribute to the reduction of social transmission of COVID-19. © 2022 The Author(s)

N2  - Purpose: While robots have increasingly threatened frontline employees’ (FLEs) future employment by taking over more mechanical and analytical intelligence tasks, they are still unable to “experience” and “feel” to occupy empathetic intelligence tasks that can be handled better by FLEs. This study, therefore, aims to empirically develop and validate a scale measuring the new so-called empathetic creativity as being creative in practicing and performing empathetically intelligent skills during service encounters. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a multistage design to develop the scale. Phase 1 combines a literature review with text mining from 3,737 service robots-related YouTube comments to generate 16 items capturing this new construct. Phase 2 assesses both face and content validity of those items, while Phase 3 recruits Prolific FLEs sample to evaluate construct validity. Phase 4 checks this construct’s nomological validity using PLS-SEM and Phase 5 experiments dedicated effort (vs natural talent) as an effective approach to foster FLEs’ perceived empathetic creativity. Findings: The final scale is comprised of 13 refined items that capture three dimensions (social, interactive and emotional) of empathetic creativity. This research provides timely implications to help FLEs in high-contact services stay competitive. Originality/value: This study introduces the new construct of empathetic creativity, which goes beyond the traditional definition of creativity in services and highlights the importance of empathetic intelligence for FLEs in future employment. This study also develops a multi-item scale to measure this construct, which can be applied to future service management research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The research question is: How are the interests of researchers changing in the field of HRM and which topics have gained popularity in recent years? Design/methodology/approach: The approach adopted in this study was designed to overcome all the limitations specific to the systematic literature reviews and bibliometric studies presented in the Introduction. The full texts of papers were analyzed. The text-mining tools detected first clusters and then trends, moreover, which limited the impact of a researcher's bias. The approach applied is consistent with the general rules of systematic literature reviews. Findings: The article makes a threefold contribution to academic knowledge. First, it uses modern methodology to gather and synthesize HRM research topics. The proposed approach was designed to allow early detection of nascent, non-obvious trends in research, which will help researchers address topics of high value for both theory and practice. Second, the results of our study highlight shifts in focus in HRM over the past 19 years. Third, the article suggests further directions of research. Research limitations/implications: In this study, the approach designed to overcome the limitations of using systematic literature review was presented. The analysis was done on the basis of the full text of the articles and the categories were discovered directly from the articles rather than predetermined. The study's findings may, however, potentially be limited by the following issues. First, the eligibility criteria included only papers indexed in the Scopus and WoS database and excluded conference proceedings, book chapters, and non-English papers. Second, only full-text articles were included in the study, which could narrow down the research area. As a consequence, important information regarding the research presented in the excluded documents is potentially lost. Third, most of the papers in our database were published in the International Journal of Human Resource Management, and therefore such trends as “challenges for international HRM” can be considered significant (long-lasting). Another – the fourth – limitation of the study is the lack of estimation of the proportion between searches in HRM journals and articles published in other journals. Future research may overcome the above-presented limitations. Although the authors used valuable techniques such as TF-IDF and HDBSCAN, the fifth limitation is that, after trends were discovered, it was necessary to evaluate and interpret them. That could have induced researchers' bias even if – as in this study – researchers from different areas of experience were involved. Finally, this study covers the 2000–2020 timeframe. Since HRM is a rapidly developing field, in a few years from now academics will probably begin to move into exciting new research areas. As a consequence, it might be worthwhile conducting similar analyses to those presented in this study and compare their results. Originality/value: The present study provides an analysis of HRM journals with the aim of establishing trends in HRM research. It makes contributions to the field by providing a more comprehensive and objective review than analyses resulting from systematic literature reviews. It fills the gap in literature studies on HRM with a novel research approach – a methodology based on full-text mining and a big data toolset. As a consequence, this study can be considered as providing an adequate reflection of all the articles published in journals strictly devoted to HRM issues and which may serve as an important source of reference for both researchers and practitioners. This study can help them identify the core journals focused on HRM research as well as topics which are of particular interest and importance. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - The goal of this study is to provide an overview of previous research that investigated pedestrian violation behaviour, with a focus on identifying the contributing factors of such behaviour, its impact on pedestrian safety, the mitigation strategies, the limitations of current studies, and the future research directions. To that end, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) text mining method was applied to extract a comprehensive list of studies that were conducted during the past 21 years related to pedestrian violation behaviours. Using the extracted studies, a multi-sectional literature review was developed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the different aspects related to pedestrian violations. Afterward, a meta-analysis was undertaken, using the studies that reported quantitative results, in order to obtain the average impact of the different contributing factors on the frequency of pedestrian violations. The study found that pedestrian violations are one of the hazardous behaviours that contribute to both the frequency and severity of pedestrian-vehicle collisions. According to the literature, the waiting time at the curbside, traffic volume, walking speed, pedestrian distraction, the presence of bus stops and schools, and the presence of on-street parking are among the key factors that increase the likelihood of pedestrian violations. The study has also reviewed a wide range of strategies that can be used to mitigate violations and reduce the safety consequences of such behaviour, including simple engineering-based countermeasures, enforcement, solutions that rely on advanced in-vehicle technologies, and infrastructure connectivity features, educational programs, and public campaigns. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Knowledge-based dynamic capabilities: a scientometric analysis of marriage between knowledge management and dynamic capabilities
AU  - Kaur, V.

N2  - Purpose: Several manuscripts are adopting knowledge-based dynamic capabilities (KBDCs) as their main theoretical lens. However, these manuscripts lack consistent conceptualization and systematization of the construct. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to advance the understanding of KBDCs by clarifying the dominant concepts at the junction of knowledge management and dynamic capabilities domains, identifying which emerging themes are gaining traction with KBDCs scholars, demonstrating how the central thesis around KBDCs has evolved and explaining how can KBDCs scholars move towards finding a mutually agreed conceptualization of the field to advance empirical assessment. Design/methodology/approach: The Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection database was used to extract 225 manuscripts that lie at the confluence of two promising management domains, namely, knowledge management and dynamic capabilities. A scientometric analysis including co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, keyword co-occurrence network analysis and text mining was conducted and integrated with a systematic review of results to facilitate an unstructured ontological discovery in the field of KBDCs. Findings: The co-citation analysis produced three clusters of research at the junction of knowledge management and dynamic capabilities, whereas the bibliographic coupling divulged five themes of research that are gaining traction with KBDCs scholars. The systematic literature review helped to clarify each clusters’ content. While scientific mapping analysis explained how the central thesis around KBDCs has evolved, text mining and keyword analysis established how KBDCs emerge from the combination of knowledge management process capabilities and dynamic capabilities. Originality/value: Minimal attention has been paid to systematizing the literature on KBDCs. Accordingly, KBDCs view has been investigated through complementary scientometric methods involving machine-based algorithms to allow for a more robust, structured, comprehensive and unbiased mapping of this emerging field of research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Purpose: This study aims to present a comprehensive review, critical analysis and implications of the augmented reality (AR) application and implementation in the construction industry arena and demonstrate the gaps along with the future research agenda. Design/methodology/approach: The construction industry has been under pressure to improve its productivity, quality and sustainability. However, the conventional methods and technologies cannot respond to this industry's ever-growing demands while emerging and innovative technologies such as building information modelling, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and AR have emerged and can be used to address this gap. AR application has been acknowledged as one of the most impactful technologies in the construction digitalization process. However, a comprehensive understanding of the AR application, its areas of effectiveness and overarching implications in a construction project life cycle remain vague. Therefore, this study uses an integration of systematic literature review and thematic analysis techniques to identify the phases of a construction project life cycle in which AR is the most effective, the current issues and problems of the conventional methods, the augmented parameters, the immediate effects of using AR on each phase and, eventually, the overall influence of AR on the entire project. Nvivo qualitative data analysis software was used to code, categorize and create themes from the collected data. The result of data analysis was used to develop four principal frameworks of the AR applications – design and constructability review session; construction operation; construction assembly; and maintenance and defect inspection and management – and the gap analysis along with the future research agenda. Findings: The findings of this study indicated that the application of AR can be most effective in the following four stages of a project life cycle: design and constructability review session; construction operation; construction assembly; and site management and maintenance, including site management and defect inspection. The results also showed that the application of AR technology in the construction industry can align and address building industry objectives by various elements such as: reducing project costs through the application of digital technologies, saving time, meeting deadlines and reduction in project delays through integrated, live scheduling and increased safety and quality of the construction work and workers. Research limitations/implications: One of the main limitations of this study was the lack of materials and resources on the downfalls and shortcomings of using immersive technologies, AR, in the construction project life cycle. In addition, most of the reviewed papers were focused on the experiments with simulations and in the lab environment, rather than real experiments in real construction sites and projects. This may cause limitations and inaccuracy of the collected and reported data. Practical implications: The results of this study indicated that the application of AR technology in construction industry can align and address building industry objectives by various elements such as: reducing project costs through the application of digital technologies; saving time; meeting deadlines and reduction in project delays through integrated, live scheduling; and increased safety and quality of the construction work and workers. Social implications: Application of AR in the various stages of a project life cycle can increase the safety and quality of the construction work and workers. Originality/value: The reviewed literature indicated that substantial research and studies are yet to be done, to demonstrate the full capacity and impact of these emerging technologies in the field. The collected data and literature indicate that amongst the digital technologies, AR is one of the least researched topics in the field. Therefore, this study aims to examine the application of AR in construction projects’ life cycle to identify the stages and practices of a project life cycle where AR and its capabilities can be exploited and to identify the respective problems and issues of the conventional methods and the ways in which AR can address those shortcomings. Furthermore, this study focuses on identifying the overall outcome of AR applications in a construction project in terms of cost and time efficiency, process precision and safety. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.
